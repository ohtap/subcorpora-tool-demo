This is Su-Yen Kuhn interviewing Annette Flattery from the class of 1958
on October 10th, no, October 8th 2008 [interview was recorded October
9th] as part of the 2008 Alumni Stories Project. So Annette, thank you so
much for taking the time to meet with us today.
Oh, I’m looking forward to this.
And I look forward to hearing your stories. Let’s just start from the basic
details. Can you tell me a little bit about where you lived at Stanford and
what your major was?
Okay. I lived in Roble first semester. I took a lot of trouble and time the
last two weeks of summer vacation to go to the beach and get all tan as I
could, so I would be just as brown as a berry and look like a California
girl. But unfortunately, I have the French side of my family’s skin and it’s
the burn and peel side. Everybody else got the Italian side and they really
tan. But I was pretty tan. And I carefully chose my outfit I’d walk into
the dorm in. I can remember I wore charcoal shorts and a chanz [i.e. Lanz
of California] blouse and white bucks. And I—when my college
roommate walked in, she was in a beautiful little dress and she had this
porcelain skin, curly hair and her name was Ann Williams. And we
became lifelong friends. I can’t wait to see her today. I lived in Roble,
1C, I believe, was my corridor.
And the next year, we figured well, we might not all draw a good number
-- we drew for housing. And so let’s all draw and put Ventura, which was
way out in the boonies; I don’t know if it exists anymore. It was out in the
boonies and you had to walk to the Union for dinner. I don’t know if any
of those things still exist. And so that’s what we did. And we got
Ventura. So we all lived in Ventura and it was great because it was very
lax. Boys would climb up the tree and come into our rooms and things
like that, which was just not done in 1958. And then from there, we all
went to Storey House on the Row. And then I took a fifth year off
campus, because you needed to to get a Masters in education. And so
Annie and Molly McCormack and Ann Silveira, who’s deceased from
breast cancer, and I all lived off campus. And I did my student teaching,
and I think the rest of them were on a program where they got half pay for

2

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANNETTE FLATTERY

actual teaching, being real classroom teachers. So, anyway, that was that
part of it.
Kuhn:
Flattery:

So it sounds like you made some lifelong friends from freshman year…
Oh yes, oh absolutely.

Kuhn:

Do you remember any special experiences or what—where did you come
from and what was different about Stanford or California that struck you?

Flattery:

Oh, you know, I had always wanted to go to Stanford. I applied to some
Eastern schools and to Stanford, and I got into them all, but there was no
doubt I was going to go to Stanford. I’d gone to a private girl’s school in
Los Angeles that was very academically oriented. We really had a
wonderful basis in languages: in language arts and reading. And I was
well read. And math wasn’t my forte. And I’d had five years of French.
And so that means—that meant I only had to do a quarter of French
reading and then I was done with my language requirement. I can
remember just loving Western Civ. And interestingly enough, being able
to figure out just what the exam questions would be, you know, after
studying, thinking “Okay, what was the biggie?” you know. And
invariably I was correct.

Kuhn:
Flattery:

Kuhn:
Flattery:

Kuhn:

Flattery:

It made you a good educator then.
Yeah. So that was good. That means I was quick in my exams. I also
took some psychology classes. I really loved them.
I understand psychology was very popular.
Yeah. I just really loved them, the Searses [SEARS, PAULINE SNEDDEN
(MRS.), Assistant Professor of Education. A.B., Stanford, 1930; M.A.,
Columbia, 1931; Ph.D., Yale, 1939. At Stanford since 1953. and SEARS,
ROBERT RICHARDSON, Professor of Psychology and Education. A.B.,
Stanford, 1929; Ph.D., Yale, 1932; M.A., Harvard, 1949. At Stanford,
1941 (Summer Quarter), and since 1953], and it was a very good
education. It held me in good stead.
What was it about psychology? Do you remember some of the classes or
professors?
Oh, the Philosophy of Education was really terrific. It had—one of our
friends, Ginger Miller, who I knew at Storey House, is still living but
having a tough time of it; she was a devout Catholic. And this Philosophy
of Education class made her suddenly start to really have to work to get
her faith and what she was believing about philosophy to, sort of,

3

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANNETTE FLATTERY

coincide, or agree, or to live happily together. But she finally did that.
And anyway, that was a fabulous course.
Kuhn:
Flattery:

Kuhn:
Flattery:
Kuhn:
Flattery:
Kuhn:

That’s terrific. And…
And I don’t support the School of Education anymore because, you know,
Stanford dropped elementary education and—for years, and they only had
administrator’s credentials, administrative credentials, so I didn’t ever
send them money. Well now, I think they’ve come to realize that that’s
really what is the most important part of education. And so they’ve
reinstituted it, but I’m still mad at them. I don’t contribute to them. I just
contribute to the university.
I’m glad there’s still something that you feel tied to at Stanford.
I can’t forgive them for that. They had such a great program. I was…
You talked about—oh, I’m sorry.
Yeah.
I was just going to say you talked about some of the great teachers and
psychology, and do you remember any important people coming here or
any great events? Classes or …?

Flattery: Oh, classes? Oh, my, I had a couple of favorite history classes. Dr. Buss’s,
[BUSS, CLAUDE A., Professor of History. A.B.,Washington Missionary
College, 1922; A.M., Susquehanna, 1924; Ph.D.,Pennsylvania, 1927;
LL.D., Southern California, 1945. At Stanford since 1946] I don’t know if
it was called Far Eastern History, but that’s what it was. That was just a
wonderful class. And Monsieur Lemaitre’s [LEMAITRE, GEORGES E.,
Professor of Romanic Languages. B, es-Lettres, Algiers, 1916; Licencie
es-Lettres, Paris, 1917, Agrege de l'Universite, 1921, Docteur es-Lettres,
1931. At Stanford since 1938] class on French History was just terrific.
Kuhn:
Flattery:

Kuhn:
Flattery:

These are both history classes?
Yeah. And I remember my biology class. My partner was John Kates, in
the lab, I think the lab was on Saturdays, I’m not sure. And John—John
was for many, many years, he just retired, the person who raised funds for
the Buck Club.
What’s the Buck Club?
The Buck Club supports Stanford athletics, I think particularly football,
and he raised funds for all athletics. And John Kates was my lab partner,

4

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANNETTE FLATTERY

and we had to dissect a fetal pig. And he just didn’t have the stomach for
it. He simply could not do it. So I dissected his fetal pig for him. I mean,
I didn’t even remember this, but I saw him at a Buck Club fundraiser in
Mission Viejo and he reminded me of it, and then I remembered. So that
was a fun memory.
Kuhn:
Flattery:
Kuhn:
Flattery:
Kuhn:

Flattery:

Kuhn:
Flattery:

So men and women couldn’t live together in dorms…
No.
…but you could be partners for biology class?
Oh, sure, oh sure. Oh yeah, we weren’t that segregated.
So what was that like living at Stanford in different dorms? You
mentioned, you know, men…
Oh, I—it was wonderful; I mean, I’m glad—I’m glad there weren’t men in
the dorms, you know. We could walk around in our bras and panties and
not even think about it. But probably women do today; anyway, it’s just
like being in a bathing suit. Things had changed when my daughter was
here. She was the class of ’83, so.
That’s great. Do you remember any student traditions or activities?
Oh, yeah, I remember the Homecoming and working on the homecoming
float. And Buzz McCoy who’s our big fundraiser for the class was the
head of Rally Comm [Rally Commission]. And I think for a quarter at
least, I worked setting up the card tricks.

Kuhn:

What are card tricks? I heard about them but I don’t know what that is.

Flattery:

Oh, well, certain sections in the student section, they’re given cards and
they have instructions about, you know, when you turn over what color,
you have red or white, I guess. I don’t know what colors we had. And
then at halftime, they would…

Kuhn:
Flattery:

Kuhn:

So you helped organize that.
Well, I would lay out the cards; somebody would have the plan already
made. I can remember one time being at a Cal Tech football game. And
of course, the students there are beyond themselves, are just, you know,
out of sight smart. And they rearranged all the cards. [laughter] So what
came up was not at all what it was supposed to be.
Did it say anything particular or was it just a jumble or mess?

Flattery:

Kuhn:
Flattery:

Kuhn:

I can’t remember. It might have said “E to the X squared” or something
like that.
That is funny. I do have to say that was well done.
And the student body was pretty conservative, you know, I think on the
whole. You know, we were all just sort of in the 50’s middle class; just
middle class people.
So there wasn’t much diversity at Stanford?

Flattery:

No diversity.

Kuhn:

No diversity.

Flattery:

Kuhn:

Flattery:

Kuhn:

We had one black student and we had an African-American woman, I
think we had two. So we had—yeah, and then there was one like, a house
mother who was African-American. And that was it.
Oh, okay. So you had one black student and then you said two female—
were they a faculty or …
No, we had one male who was an athlete and we had one female who was
a student.
Oh, okay. Did you have any classes or interact with them? Or do you
know…

Flattery:

Sure, it was very natural. Unlike when my daughter came -- she had
grown up in an Air Force community where there was absolutely no
segregation -- and she found that she was really shunned by the AfricanAmericans here. And so it was—and her good friend, Robin, from high
school who was African-American found the same thing to be true at the
University of Missouri where she went. So…

Kuhn:

So even though there was only one or two at the time that you were here,
it felt a lot more inclusive.

Flattery:
Kuhn:
Flattery:

Yes, yeah. It shouldn’t have been just one or two though.
Right, right.
And we had a few Asian students but not many.

Kuhn:

Kuhn:

And so you never felt any tension, it just seemed like everybody was
equal.
Oh, no, no, not at all.
That’s great. In regards to the student activities, you talked about the card
tricks. Do you remember any other—downstairs they had, you know,
what the class of 2008, their favorite memories were. And they talked
about, like, Full Moon on the Quad or the Bonfire…
Yeah, no, I didn’t pay much attention to Full M—I loved going to the
library to study.
Which library?

Flattery:

Cubberley.

Kuhn:

Cubberley.

Flattery:

And I loved Rossotti’s; that was always fun on a Friday night.
What is Rossotti’s? What is that?
It’s the beer joint out of town.
Okay.
And I loved meeting Tom.
How did you meet Tom?
Well, Tom was a hasher at Storey House when I lived there.
Oh, okay.
Because he’d lost these two years, so he was now class of ’58, and he
earned his meals by being a hasher. And he lived off campus in a little
house that his mother had purchased; and he was to make the house
payments, but it was cheap in those days. And she was with the Red
Cross and they sent her to Japan. Just—you know, this was just post war.
And so Tom had some very interesting roommates on Homer Lane [i.e.,
Homer Street in Palo Alto?]. And he had this garage thing, and they had a
big printing press in the garage. And so for our first date, Tom invited me
to the opera in San Francisco. And I was amazed because Tom was really
a starving student; he really was. And when we got in the car, he said
“Here are the tickets, I printed them myself on my printing press.” He

7

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANNETTE FLATTERY

said “We’re going to sit in seats 102 and 103.” And I said “What? What
if people bought the tickets for 102 and 103?” And he said, “Well, we’ll
just get up and move to two other empty seats.” This was his plan.
Well, see, I was just too bourgeois for that. I just couldn’t stand that
thought, so I made him buy standing room tickets. And we stood in the
back and we listened to Turandot for about as long as we could stand
standing in the back. And then we left and went to dinner before the opera
was over. And I’ve since seen the opera twice and it’s just a magnificent
opera. I love it dearly, and it reminds of that time. But when we got to the
restaurant, Tom said, “Well, look at the menu sparingly, because you
made me buy standing room tickets. I don’t have enough money to pay
for a real dinner.” So I think what happened was, I think I sort of
subsidized and we did have a dinner. So anyway, Tom—I married him
anyway, can you imagine?

You did, and you’re still married after all these years.
And life was just—yes, forty-nine years. And life was, has just been
wonderful. Tom has taught me self-restraint and kindness. I love him
dearly.
That’s wonderful. And your husband’s name is Tom Flattery.
Yes.
And what was your maiden name?
My maiden name was LaBrucherie. And my dad [Bert LaBrucherie; d.
1981] was born in L.A. in 1905. He married my mother Enis Montrestelli,
whom he saw get off the bus at L.A. High and thought she was the most
beautiful woman he’d ever seen. And Dad was head coach at UCLA
when I was in elementary school, head football coach. So I was extremely
popular with the boys. They all wanted to walk me home because they
thought maybe they’d meet my dad. But still at Stanford the name carried
over, you know, people remembered my dad in 1958 still. Anyway.
So were you involved in the football program here? Did you enjoy
football games?
Oh, I enjoy watching football. Tom is lucky to have a wife that just
knows a little bit about it and loves to sit there and watch it with him.
Oh that’s good. Will he be there on Saturday?
Oh, you bet. And hopefully somebody’s going to see this Obama button.

Oh, I’m sure they will.
I hope so.
What about any student clubs, did you belong to any student clubs?
No.
No. And how did you—I know that Tom was a hasher at Storey, but how
did you two meet? Who started the conversation?
Oh he did. He was always saying, “Hurry up girls, hurry up girls” because
he wanted to be finished, you know, and go out and sit down on the piano
and play the Moonlight Sonata.
Oh, he was a piano player, pianist.
Well, he played it by ear. He had the music but he also played it by ear.
And I remember one special after dinner visitor, we had a sociology
professor that came from UCLA, as a matter of fact. And she was doing a
history of athletics in sociology. And she took me aside and she said, “Do
you know that your dad was the first person in the country to integrate a
team?” When dad was at L.A. High in the 20’s and 30’s, an AfricanAmerican man and wife moved into the L.A. High area so their son could
play for dad, because dad won all the-city national—all the city
championships. And then this kid followed dad to UCLA, where he
played and then he even played pro ball. And she said “That’s the earliest
record of any team being integrated.” So I felt very, very proud.
And he never told you this?
No, and that man and his wife were at dad’s fiftieth—my dad and mom’s
fiftieth wedding anniversary.
Wow, well that’s wonderful.
Yeah, I have a picture.
So I guess Stanford teams were integrated since we had that one athlete
that you mentioned.
Yeah.
And do you remember what sport he played?

Football.
Oh, he played football, okay. And—but he wasn’t—do you know if he
was the first one or were there others before him?
I don’t think there were others before him. I’m not sure
That’s very interesting. And how did you celebrate graduation? Do you
recall?
You know, I didn’t go to my graduation.
Oh you didn’t?
My family took me to Italy and—or to Europe. And we ended up in Italy.
We ended up in the little town where I have relatives. And we stayed
there for a couple of—couple of months I guess. My friend, Ann Silveira
Donaldson, who has since passed away from breast cancer, way too young
--she was also an education major and a dynamite teacher -- she came with
us. And then suddenly Tom managed to appear in Florence somehow.
And so the three of us took a car and we drove, you know, to Germany
and Austria and places like that.
Wow, he followed you to the ends of the earth.
Yes. And I finally caught him. So anyway, that was lots of fun.
So do you remember anything fun about senior year then?
Anything about senior year? I don’t remember anything special. Every
year it was wonderful.
I agree.
Yeah, I don’t remember senior year as anything much more different.
Was—did the campus change much during the time you were here, as you
can see now there’s…
Well I think Lagunita was built during the time I was here.
Oh, the dorms?
…or being built. Yeah.
So before when there was a bonfire in Lake Lag, it was…

Oh, yeah, there was a bonfire. We always had a bonfire.
Tell me about the bonfire.
I don’t remember, it was just…
Big.
…a wonderful bonfire. And I remember we beat Cal so we got the Ax.
All four years or …?
I don’t think so, I think maybe just the last year. We had a really good
team.
And what was the celebration like when we won the Ax?
Oh, you know, just lots of levity.
So was Lake Lag filled or…
Yes.
It was filled?

Flattery:

Well it had times when it was up and times when it wasn’t quite so up.

Kuhn:

Okay, okay. And that’s when we would do the bonfire, is when it was
down.

Flattery:

Kuhn:
Flattery:

I don’t know where they did it exactly, but it was out there by the barn. Is
the barn still there?
It was when I was here. I think it’s still here.
I’m going to let you open that for me.
Sure, I will try. Here we go.
And I had another boyfriend most of the time through Stanford.
Oh, you did.
He was class of ’56. And I think I was attracted to him because he was
mean to me. He wasn’t very nice to me. You know, how the unattainable

11

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANNETTE FLATTERY

is sort of attractive. Oh, my parents hated him, just hated him. And my
mother thought Tom was the nicest man she’d ever met. She was right.
Anyway, he’s now deceased; he became a psychiatrist, quite a famous
psychiatrist. And, uh, he’s now deceased. [Ringing cell phone] I’ll just
turn it off.
Kuhn: Sure.
Flattery:

If I can find it. Where are you? I know you’re in a pocket somewhere.
[Shuts off cell phone]

Kuhn: And it was very interesting downstairs [in the Alumni Center] they have
that class of 2008, and they had a statistic, and they did a pie chart but it
was out of a heart and it said, you know, “How many romantic
relationships have you had at Stanford?” Did you see that downstairs?
Flattery:
Kuhn:

Flattery:
Kuhn:
Flattery:
Kuhn:

Hm umm.
So fifty-six percent had one or two. Seventeen percent had zero. And, oh,
a small percentage, maybe five percent, had over five. And then, you
know, the rest had between two and five. And so I thought it was very
interesting how most of Stanford had one or two. So I think you fit that
statistic. Were there other relationships you heard about at Stanford that
that continued on … [ringing cell phone]. You’re very popular.
Sorry.
No problem.
I think it’s just my sister calling, actually, from Irvine.
Anything about relationships at Stanford, or do you recall a funny story?

Flattery:

Oh, I just met so many—made so many lifelong friends. And, you know,
many of the girls from my high school went to Stanford. And they are
here today.

Kuhn:

Do you remember what the percentage of women were compared to men?

Flattery:

Kuhn:
Flattery:

Oh, I think they outnumbered us by a lot, but I don’t remember the exact
percentage. And the classes were smaller.
You mean the…?
And it wasn’t so hard to get into Stanford.

12

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANNETTE FLATTERY

Kuhn:
Flattery:

Really?
No, not like it is today.

Kuhn:

So the classes being—the classes you took with a professor, or the overall
number of people in your classes of ’58?

Flattery:

Probably both. I can remember Art—Art 101, what was the man’s name?
Anyway, we would have a quiz every week about the art we’d seen. And
so one time Tom came in and he made out his own quiz. And he grabbed
the quiz papers from the front table and he put his quiz in and replaced it.
It was hysterical.

Kuhn: And the professor didn’t notice until later?
Flattery:

Kuhn:
Flattery:
Kuhn:

Flattery:

No—well, yes he did notice. Everybody said “What?”
Was Tom just trying…

.

He was just full of stuff like that.
He was trying to get your attention get your attention?

No, I guess so. Farmer—Mr. Farmer, Dr. Farmer. [FARMER, EDWARD
McNEIL, Professor of Art. A.B., Stanford, 1923, A.M., 1926. At Stanford
since 1923]

Kuhn:

Oh that was the—that was the professor’s name. Any other funny stories
or fun classes?

Flattery:

Well, I guessed really at the end, I kind of wished I’d been a psychology
major. But I did teach for twenty-one years. After my kids started junior
high, I began to teach. And I taught in three states. And I’m really glad I
have my little pension now.

Kuhn:

Flattery:

Um hmm, um hmm, so after graduation, did you and Tom have children
or…
Yes, we went to England, the kids were born in England. And I just was a
stay-at-home mom. And then the Air Force sent Tom to the University of
Chicago to get his PhD in Geophysical Science. And he was extremely
impressed with that school. And the kids and I lived way far away; you
know, we lived in someplace we could afford, which was Park Forest,

13

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANNETTE FLATTERY

Illinois. We lived in a little three bedroom—two bedroom—three
bedroom house. And so we were there for two years. And then we went
to Belleville, Illinois where Tom was allowed essentially to complete his,
a dissertation. And Tom developed a mathematical model of the
atmosphere that predicted—it used tidal theory to kind of suppose
[hypothesize] data over the Pacific Ocean where there weren’t
observations. And it was used to predict weather until about, I don’t
know, eight or nine years ago.

Wow. So what is it that you and Tom like most about Stanford, coming
back?
Oh, just the whole atmosphere. It’s just beautiful to be here. We tried to,
when he retired, move up here. And we thought we always would one
day. But it was the time of Jimmy Carter’s, what was it called,
‘stagflation,’ and interest rates were like twenty-three percent or
something. So I got a teaching job right away and Tom had a job with
Lockheed. But—and we bid on a house in Los Altos. It was tiny but it
was beautiful. And they didn’t accept our offer, and our house didn’t sell
in Irvine, so we decided that I should go back home…
To Irvine?
Yeah, Fremont let me out of the contract. They didn’t want to, they called
Tom and said “Do you really want me to let her out of this contract?” And
he said “Yes,” so I went back and taught in Long Beach, and he would
come home on weekends.
And so he was still working at Lockheed?
He was working at Lockheed. He’d work five days then catch the plane
and come home for the weekend. And I would fix him little meals in little
containers, and he would take them up for the week. And he had a little
house with a—out back of somebody’s house. And he had a microwave
and kitchen utensils and that kind of thing. So…
And the two of you still live down there?
And I lived in L.A.
At—do you still live…
I mean, I lived in Irvine.
Right.

Flattery:
Kuhn:
Flattery:

Same house we’ve always had...
Oh really.
...since 1980.

Kuhn:

Wow, wow. And so do you think one day you might settle back out here?

Flattery:

No, I think if we do—we have two kids: we have Jennifer in Oakland.
She’s an environmental epidemiologist with the Health Department. And
we have David and Judy; David is our son. He lives in Santa Barbara.
And I think we would probably live closer to the “Santa Barbarians”
because they are just less busy than Jennifer. Jennifer and Mark are so
busy; their kids are little still, they’re nine and seven. And David’s kids
are teenagers. Samantha wants to come to Stanford, the middle child, and
probably Jocelyn too. And I think we would move there.

Kuhn:
Flattery:
Kuhn:

Flattery:

Kuhn:

And you said your daughter Jennifer went to Stanford as well?
She did, yeah.
And so what were some of the differences that you saw between your
experience and her experience?
Well, Stanford was very integrated. And the dorms were co-ed. And I
don’t think she much cared for that either. She was also a—what were
they called, an RA ?...
Resident Assistant.

Flattery:

…at Toyon. And her—the house parents, or whatever they were called,
were from Antigua. And they became fast friends, and Jennifer visited
Antigua before she was married; had a reunion with the others. She had
this great—she’s a great photographer. She’s a climber. She once told me
that if she had discovered climbing, she probably would—before Stanford,
she probably wouldn’t have gone to Stanford. So she still climbs. So, I
mean, their life is busy. You know, they got the soccer and the baseball
and the ‘this’ and the ‘that’ and piano lessons and …

Kuhn:

Was life like that for—I know that you were traveling around with the Air
Force with the kids, but was it that busy?

Flattery:

Well, sometimes, yeah: I was the Girl Scout leader and I was the Cub
Scout leader. And we lived in Washington, D.C. so it was just a great
place. There were so many free things to do with the kids. One time I had
the Boy Scouts making kites on my kitchen floor. And then we got Paul

Garber, who was the—I don’t know whether he was head of Aeronautics
or what he was at the Smithsonian -- and he came out and he showed the
kids all these kites. [Paul Garber, 1899-1992; first curator of the
Smithsonian’s Air Museum] There was every year a kite flying contest on
the Mall where people had worked for a year on their kites. And we
would all go to—always go to that with some little kite we’d made.

Washington, D.C.
In D.C., wow.
Great place to live. We lived in Maryland about—not far from the
District, and Tom worked in Maryland for the National Weather Service.
He was still in the Air Force though.
Um hmm. So of all the experiences that you had at Stanford, what was
your most favorite?
You know, I just loved every minute of it. I’m trying to thi—I guess
maybe—well, I loved Storey House and the camaraderie and friendships I
made at Storey House. And I loved working on the floats for
homecoming. That was just always a highlight.
So did every dorm or group make a float? Or how does that work?
I think we must’ve.
And then where was the parade route?
It must’ve been around the stadium at halftime. The stadium was way
different before they leveled it. And Prince Lightfoot, who is now not
fashionable, was superb…
I’m sorry, I don’t know what Prince Light…
Prince Lightfoot, oh, he was this wonderful guy in an Indian headdress. I
think he was an actual Native-American.
Oh, that’s right, that’s right.
And he would—I think he rode a horse just like Tommy Trojan, you
know, with his arrow…
Yes, it was the mascot before the Tree.

Yeah.
Yes, yes.
And you know, it was the year my daughter was there that they decided
they had to change from the Stanford Indians. And what everybody
wanted them to be was the Robber Barons. But the university wouldn’t
allow it. So you became the Cardinal.
Yes, we became a color, yes, that’s correct. It’s not even a bird, it’s a
color. Yeah, that always perplexed me as I was applying.
And Jennifer was in the band for the famous ‘play.’ [Big Game 1982, at
Cal]
Oh really?

Oh how fun that you both have the same reunion year.
Yeah, she’s not going to come, though. It’s not her thing. But Gary, the
trombonist who actually fell down in the end zone and blocked out the
Stanford player that could’ve made a tackle, is coming. And he’s going to
be playing all around; they’re going to play, a group of them, all around. I
thought Jennifer should come with her sax and play with the band because
that’s what she played. But she swears the whistle had blown. And she
knows football, so I don’t know.
So was the Band and the Dollies any different between your year and her
year? Or was it pretty much the same chaos?
Well, I don’t know about the Dollies. I knew Dollies; Dianne Fan—
Feinstein was a Dollie.
Really? Here?
Uh huh.
Same time that you were here?

And she was also a Stanford Queen. They used to have a section where
they had Queens in the yearbook, and they would pick out somebody who
thought they’re the prettiest and…
So there was one Queen every year?
No, there were three or four.
Oh, so what does—I’m sorry, I did not know this. Is Dianne Feinstein the
same year as you?
No, she’s a couple years ahead.
Oh, okay, okay. And she was a Dollie?
Yeah. She went to Lowell High School [in San Francisco] with my
husband.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, good woman. I like Dianne.
Do you remember any other famous people in our midst at the time?
Oh, yeah, Knowland, the head of the paper. What was her name? Estelle
Knowland [Helen Estelle Knowland] was a student here. She may have
been in my class, actually. And her father was the Oakland something
newspaper, [Oakland Tribune] I think, and a friend of Hearst’s. [William
Fife Knowland, 1908-1974. Editor, President and publisher of the
Oakland Tribune; U.S. senator 1945-1959.]
Wonderful. Yeah, Tiger Woods came a couple years after we started…
Oh yeah.
He was here at the same time and of course, you know, he left but…
Oh, he didn’t finish.
He didn’t finish. But, oh well, he had a career, I mean, you know, this
career can only go on—well, it’s been going on for years but the rumor
was, and I don’t know if this is true or not, but he was the only person I
know at Stanford who was ever mugged. Poor fellow, you know, his
freshman year.
Really, they were mugging people at Stan…

But I don’t know if that’s true or not, that he ever actually got mugged.
That was what I heard.
Wow.
So is there anything else in particular you’d like to share or that you
recall?
Oh I’m sure if I sat and thought a minute. My sister; it was fun, my sister
was here. My sister was the class of ’54, so she was getting her Masters in
education my freshman year. She had skipped a grade and so she
graduated at 16. And she was quite a beautiful woman. So I didn’t know
quite how to take it when people would say to me, “You’re Jean
LaBrucherie’s sister?” Anyway, it was fun to have her here while I was
here. She told me not to marry Tom because it just wouldn’t work out.
She’s the one that got divorced. And she married a man who also went to
Stanford, who’d never dated while he was here. He was really a nerd.
She was kind of his first date in his whole life. And that only lasted
twelve years. But it was fun to have her here. And my friends and I
would always go ask advice on this and that from the wise big sister.
That’s right.
Sometimes it was good, sometimes it was bad.
The advice?
Yes.
Oh great. Well thank you so much, again for your time.
Oh, I enjoyed it thoroughly.
And, you know, if there’s anything you recall later, you know, just let
Charlotte know and I’m sure we can…
Okay. Can I e-mail you …
Yes.
…that?

So what is the Stanford cop?
Oh, there was a Stanford cop and he was kind of an old lecher, you know.
He would come on to the co-eds.
Oh really? So there was one poli—was he really…
One policeman…
Okay.
…for Stanford. It was Stanford’s policeman.
What were some of the stories that you recall?
Oh, oh! I have a great story about somebody else. Kerensky was at the
Hoover Institute. You’ve heard of Kerensky? He was a Russian
revolutionist and he came to the Hoover Institute. [Alexander Fyodorovich
Kerensky, 1881-1970, Prime Minister of the Russian Provisional
Government, 1917] And one day my friend Ann Walton, Ann Williams
Walton, my roommate, was walking down the street with her boyfriend.
And she started to run and Ted started to chase her. And Kerensky came
around with his cane, I mean, he’s an old man now in his eighties, “Stop,
stop,” he was running after them with his cane, “Stop, stop.” And so they
stopped and they explained to him that they were just playing. So that was
fun. Tom worked in the Hoover Library as one of his jobs. And he
worked in a shed next to Hoover Library separating World War II
newsreels from Spain and Germany. And his job was to take the nitrate
films and put them in a bin because, you know, those catch fire, and
separate out the others. And so he did that, and when there were
duplicates, the university allowed him to take the duplicates. So we still
have this big box of these propaganda films in German and Spanish at
home.
Wow.
And during his Air Force career, he would—if somebody retired or if they
moved away or reassigned, he would make a little video tape where he
would splice in some of the German newsreels and some real footage and
make a narrative to go along with it. And it was great fun. It took him
hours to do it.

Wow. I was going to say he’s multitalented and…
Yes he is. Oh, and then there was my poetry class; forgot about that.
Annie and I took a poetry class, and we wrote these poems that we thought
were magnificent. Well, Tom looked at them and he kind of chuckled and
it gave him an idea. So he and his brother got on that printing press that
they’d printed the opera tickets with, and they made a book of poems.
Some of them they found were for real and some of them they made up,
and they put Annie’s and my poems in there. And it was called La Poetry
Mal. And they did a big woodblock -- David could do woodblocks -- on
the front. And they sold them at the City Lights Bookstore for fifty cents
apiece.
Wow!
So Tom had spent some time copying them now and I hope he brought his
copies with him. And we were going to give them to some friends.
Yeah, how fun.
Yeah, crazy man I married.

Kuhn: Sounds like you had some great adventures here at Stanford…
Flattery:

We did.
