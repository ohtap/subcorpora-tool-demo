VS: ... interview with Ginny Page for the Community Committee for International Students Oral History Project at Stanford University. It is conducted by Gertie Williams and Ginny Spears at the Page residence in Palo Alto on April the fifteenth, 1987. [tape pauses; some microphone adjustments]
VS: Ginny, this is indeed a good time for us to hear about the early days of the CCIS. When were you first interested, and how did it happen?
VP: We had been in Japan for two years under the Occupation, 1950 ... 1949 to 1952, and while I was there I became so interested in students in Japan that when we came back to Stanford I thought I wanted to do something about them. I knew there wasn't any kind of organization that the university had that really dealt with what we thought was the problem. So I went to see Werner Warmbrunn; I believe he was the first foreign student advisor and had been appointed just shortly before that. And I made an appointment and went in, and I told him my idea, and he nodded all the time that we were talking, and he said that three of us had been thinking of this at the same time. He said, "I have an appointment with Joan Lane who also has an idea of some sort of organization," and he said, "I'm the third person who's been thinking we needed a community-university organization to work with the foreign students." And this was in 1952 ­ I'm not sure exactly; I came back in January and whether it was that spring or fall, I don't remember. But we gathered in three other people: Pat Chadwick, Sheila Spaeth, and Carolyn Liere ­ no, Jean Shen, not Carolyn; Carolyn came in later. Jean Shen was the fifth member. And we formed what we at the time named the Community Committee for International Students because we couldn't think of a better name and we said "Oh, in a few years, someone will be more inspired." And here we are, still with the Community Committee for International Students.
VS: But many times having considered making another choice.
VP: Of course! But always coming back to ... CCIS is fine but if you say the whole thing, it's really a mouthful. Well, it all began from that, and as time went on, I can't remember what years they came in, but one of the early ones was Carolyn ­ I can't even think of ­
VS: Carolyn Baer?
VP: Carolyn Baer [Bayer?] and Pat Keyes; they were probably the next two who were added onto the group. Sheila was in from the beginning; Mary Stegner ­ no, it's hard to know ­ along the way Kay Millar ­ I can't remember after that when different people came in. But I remember our first meeting: I think it was at Sheila's house, and there was a discussion of who was going to be the first chairman, with every one of the five of us trying to get the other one to do it. The final word was we all turned on Joan and said, "Look, Joan, you're just married and you don't have any children yet; why don't you take the first chairmanship, and we'll all take turns after that?" So of course the next chairman was Pat Chadwick, and then I came, and then Pat Keyes, and then Carolyn Baer, and then I'm lost after that. But it started out
Page 1 of 14

in such a small way; Werner was such a marvelous person to work with, full of ideas and ways to do things. And the rapport within the group was simply wonderful, and I think it still is. We've never lost that.
VS: What did you feel was your first priority of activity?
VP: I think to make the students feel at home in American society; we were anxious to get them into community homes, and also have a place where they could go if they had any kind of problem and talk with people. I think our first headquarters, if I remember, were in the Old Union, in what they called the Nightery or something, you know, up above the Cellar. And then eventually we got Bailey Willis' house [539 Lasuen], which burned down, at least burned so badly they tore it down, and then eventually of course, the Bechtel's.
VS: The Bechtel Center.
GW: Did you start with Homestay, then, as the first activity, or did you try simultaneously to do a number of things?
VP: I think we tried to do a number of things at once. We wanted to -- we wanted to have a place that we manned certain hours where they could come if they needed any kind of help on campus. But then the second thing was, we thought if they could come and live in an American home, and hear American English, and find friends who would carry on through their time at Stanford: friends in the community, not just friends at Stanford. And I think those were our two priorities.
VS: Did you have close contact with some individual students, or did you have contact with all?
VP: Well, there weren't as many then, you know, Ginny. I've forgotten how many we had at first, but it was a small percentage of the student body compared with the number we have now, or at least a small number; maybe I shouldn't say percentage, because the university has grown so. Students responded immediately, both the American and the foreign students, to this idea. We were the ones who took them in our homes as I remember to begin with, every year and during the year when different ones would come, and we'd each have them: whoever had an empty room would take them in. And then we began to feel they were getting, not getting a broad enough view of American society; that was one thing that worried us almost from the beginning. Because we wanted them not just to go into homes, let's say, good middle-class homes, we wanted them to be in homes where there weren't as many privileges too, to see how different segments of our society live. That was kind of important to us. So we started the program, I think, of going out and re-canvassing areas if we didn't get enough of a response, and sizing people up, and deciding whether we thought they had any racial feelings, and whether it would be a good home for a foreign student.
GW: You were helping students find permanent housing as well.
VP: We were doing that too; I can't remember at what point these things happened. I think our main idea was to gently ease them into American society, and give them some friends, hopefully, who would be permanent: people who would invite them over during the year instead of having them as a Homestay student and then [inaudible, several voices at once]
VS: And how did you strengthen the friendships with those students? Did you, just by having them in your home, or ...
VP: Yes, doing things with them: all the members of our original group had children at home, and so it was natural for them to come into our homes: it was good for our children too, as far as that's concerned. And of course having just come from Japan I was particularly eager to have Japanese students, because
Page 2 of 14

I'd known a lot there, and I became acquainted with those who were coming to Stanford that very year, while I was still in Japan, because we had a Stanford Alumni meeting and as a matter of fact, several of them, I guess, met up with the students, so ...
VS: It gave them an edge.
VP: Yes, "I'll see you when you get over there. I'm going home in January." I was already home then, of course. Before I left, I would say to them, "I'll see you because I'm going home in January."
VS: Do you still keep in contact with some of those original students?
VP: Oh, goodness, yes. And I've seen them when I've travelled. You become so fond of them when, I think, when you know them in this way, because they're not surrounded by their own home support group, and they have the need of some kind of support group here. And they turn to the people ­ they turn to the CCIS all the time.
VS: The people that helped them in the beginning.
VP: Exactly. And with such gratitude ­ did you tape Henrietta [Kershaw] before?
VS: Yes.
VP: Oh, thank goodness because ­ did you meet the Japanese who came?
VS: I did not, no. Did you? You did, didn't you?
VP: Who came from Japan, and I've never been more touched in my life. He was here ­ Henrietta was involved early, too, I've forgotten at what point, because she was a good friend of mine ­ but Henrietta Kershaw made such close friends with these people. She was living alone, and she, very often she liked them in Homestay she'd keep that person on as a roomer during the year. But this one student wrote to me because Henrietta, in the last few months of her life, asked me if I would keep in touch with her two, closest foreign students, both of whom were Japanese, and so I was corresponding with them all through the last few months of her life. And when one of them found that she was very ill, he planned to come over here, but he didn't come quite in time. He came a month later, I guess it was, and he came and walked around her garden, and sat in her garden for a long time.
VS: How touching.
VP: And he wanted to go to the place where there's a memorial to her up in the foothills, but it was too far away for him to get there, and so he couldn't. But this is the kind of thing: there's a devotion that has been built up with some of them. One of our very best friends was an Afghan, and we don't know where he is now since the, what we call invasion of Afghanistan [1979], and other people ...
VS: Was he one of the early Afghans? One of the earlier? Do you remember his name?
VP: Yes; oh, goodness, yes, I should say: Abdul Saleem [Abdul Samad Saleem, B.S. geology 1952; M.S. 1954]
GW: He was an Afghan prince, wasn't he? There was one who came early.
VP: No, he came from a very humble family, but he was a very intelligent man, and his government sent him over here for his undergraduate work, which was elsewhere, and then to do graduate work in geology at Stanford. So we had the combination of having him living in our home part of the time and also Ben was his professor, [Mrs. Page's husband, Benjamin Markham Page, was a Professor of Geology. A.B.,
Page 3 of 14

Stanford, 1933, A.M., 1934, Ph.D., 1940. At Stanford since 1943; they lived at 551 Foothill, Stanford.] and so that was a double bond with him. When we went to Afghanistan while the King was still the head of the government, our friend Abdul Saleem was Minister of Mining and Mineral Industry, and in fact he invited us to come there; he had been inviting us ever since he'd gone home. And we had a month there, and we saw Afghanistan and knew Afghan people, as one could never do it otherwise. Don't know where he is now.
VS: It's very sad.
VP: That's right; we just hope that they're all well. [Saleem is listed in the 2012 alumni directory living in Australia; he lived in Kabul for many years.]
VS: What about some of your Japanese students? You had many over the years.
VP: Oh goodness, yes. We had a lot of them. We have not kept in as close touch with them; there have been certain people along the way, and a little later there was one from Japan; can't even think of his name now. But he eventually came back; he didn't like the life in Japan after he went home, and he is back in the United States now, and we keep in touch with him. But our main friends in Japan are people who became very close friends there; they were not Stanford students.
VS: Do you have some particular memory as being the most rewarding over the years?
VP: I think maybe the Smostrieds one. And that all came through English In Action.
VS: This is a student ­ tell us about ­ it's a Chinese student?
VP: Yes, from mainland China. And he'd only been married a month when he came over here, but his wife couldn't come. And he really spoke very good English.
VS: What was his name?
VP: His name is Xi Zheng-Min ­ X-I ­ and I can't really spell ... [Zheng-Min Xi, PhD physics 1985]
VS: What was his field?
VP: His field is physics; he is a theoretical physicist. And they called from CCIS because I was on their list to do English In Action, and asked if I would be interested in having a student from the Mainland. Well, again, we had just been there, so I was very interested in having one. I had not met him there, however. And so we decided right from the start that we would rather meet here in my home instead of out at the I Center. He loved coming into our house, and we'd either have tea or he'd stay for dinner, and so he met Ben and we got to know one another well. And I've known him for seven and a half years.
VS: That's quite a long time, longer than most of the students.
VP: A long time, and he is really like a part of our family; he's one of our very closest friends.
VS: And his wife came too? [unclear remarks]
VP: Our very two closest friends, yes, among the foreign students.
VS: You mentioned that he was going home today; what is he going home to do? Do you know?
Page 4 of 14

VP: He's going home to work at the National Academy of Science, which is a very prestigious organization. He was offered three different jobs; he said the very best one he was offered was one where his wife couldn't be with him. And so he took the second best; I think he's taken the second-best. He said, "We had ­ I had five years here in the United States without her before she came, and we'd only had a month of married life together before that, and I decided that I didn't want any more years passing and being separated." So he said "I think I'm going to the Academy of Science to do research."
VS: Is this in Beijing?
VP: Yes. Ben and I visited there; Ben gave a talk there when we were in Beijing.
VS: Well then, the chances of you seeing him again there are perhaps not too remote.
VP: Not too remote, no; not too remote.
VS: Because you travel. Did they have children while they were here?
VP: No. No, he had too much ahead of him, I think, for them to start a family. They're a very practical couple; they both went through the Cultural Revolution and had a difficult time, and I think as a result of that, they are trying to take everything very slowly. But they're going home.
VS: And that's the important thing.
VP: And I've always felt with the foreign students, they should go home, wherever they came from. And if it doesn't work out, especially if they've been sent by their government - if it doesn't work out then it's fine if they come back, but they oughtn't to stay here, because they owe it to their governments to help them. That was one of the tenets of the CCIS from the very beginning: never encourage a foreign student to stay on here. And I think we've sort of stood by that.
VS: I hope so.
VP: Me too.
VS: Sometimes from different areas of the world it seems as though they don't go home as easily. Do you have any moments that were very difficult, and well, you might categorize the worst moments in counseling with students?
VP: I think it was the men who were here without their wives, and ... they had none of their family around them at all, and when things got difficult, they would pour out their problems to whoever they knew best here and very often it was one of us in the CCIS. I think we've all had them bring their problems to us, and all they needed to do was to talk it out, and then they were able to go on. And I think that was the hardest, I think particularly with Zheng-Min, when he was alone for five years without anyone and had left his bride at home. That began to get pretty rough toward the end of five years.
VS: It's a hard thing, to come and know that it will be a long time. We go and think maybe a few months you'd be separated, but to know it's a matter of years ...
VP: Well, that's what he thought, you know.
VS: Oh, did he?
VP: He always kept hoping from year to year.
Page 5 of 14

VS: He didn't go home in between?
VP: No, he couldn't afford to go home.
VS: That's difficult.
VP: No, he had to stay, and he had to get all the work of any kind. He stood so well in the Physics Department; as a matter of fact, he was the TA [teaching assistant] for my grandson at Stanford.
VS: Oh, how interesting!
VP: He was the one who talked Benjamin into taking a physics course that he was TA for it, and he wanted so to have our grandson to become a physicist; was very disappointed to hear he was going to be an economist instead, [laughs]which we just learned ourselves.
VS: Were there embarrassing moments? Were there difficult situations in the realm of culture differences?
VP: Oh, I don't think ever really any. I think if you've lived and traveled abroad yourself, you know, you know there are differences. Once in a while we'd give them something to eat, and with Zheng-Min and his wife who had dinner with us the night before last, I gave them artichokes; I gave them things that I knew they might not have again, and I said ... I did give them pork because I knew they liked that, and I said, "Now, I'm giving you things you may not have for a while until you come back again," and so I gave them artichokes and things of that sort that I felt would be different from home. But occasionally you'd find someone you wouldn't realize you were giving them something that maybe they kind of disliked; that's the only real trouble I ever remembered, that being a bit about what kind of food.
VS: Were you ever invited into their home?
VP: Oh, goodness, yes. I think all of us were, and they go to so much trouble ­ not if it was a man alone, and I think most of the time I had men alone rather than family. And I don't know how that happened. After I'd been deeply involved in the CCIS, and then we took a sabbatical and were away for a year, it was after I returned from that that I think I began doing less in the CCIS. And so from then on whenever I did anything, it was usually I had a lone male student, not one with family.
GW: Ginny, were there fewer, do you think perhaps there were fewer families in the early days?
VP: Maybe that was it; it could have been that. Now of course there were a few families; I had a Costa Rican, for instance, just three or four years ago, maybe even two years ago, and his English was absolutely perfect. You knew he was just looking for a friend: even though he had his wife here, he wanted an American friend. And I used to tease him and say, "You don't need any help with your English at all," and he'd say, "Oh, yes, I do; my vocabulary needs to be increased." But that was one couple that I had; they had no children. I can't remember many families. And if they were men alone, usually they didn't try to cook for you.
VS: Did you meet many of them through Ben, your husband's, department, or was it mostly through the I-Center and English In Action?
VP: Mostly through the I-Center. That was another reason I became less active in the CCIS, too, was because there were foreign students in his school. And, strangely, they never seemed to go to the I-Center.
Page 6 of 14

The scientists seemed to be so terribly busy with their own work, at least in my experience. They didn't go to the I-Center for help or housing or anything else; they turned to the School of Earth Science[s].
VS: That must speak well for that particular department, because some departments do better in that than others.
V P: I think so too; I think Earth Science ... and they had to work so hard; they didn't have much time to fool around, I think, in that school.
VS: Can you think of specifics, of specific students, and what they have done when they've gone home, if you know?
VP: Of course you heard me speak of Abdul; oh, yes, and then Shimazaki, another good friend and his wife, Yoko ­ what was Yoko's last name? They were married here; were you involved then too? Well, they were among our earliest students, and I remember when we began raising money for our annual whatever we called it. I think it still goes on, but it started in a small, money-raising way. We all did the cooking and sold ...
VS: For an international festival?
VP: Exactly.
VS: It's amusing now that it's starting again, and they think it's a brand new idea.
VP: Do they?
VS: Yes.
VP: Oh, Ginny, we started that way back in the beginning, and we started having it at the end of the orientation period; we always had an outdoor barbecue for them, usually at the home of one of the CCIS people because, you know, there weren't so many that they couldn't be taken care of that way. Oh, and I know another one who's, I guess is he Turkish? He teaches at the University of Washington now; well, maybe I'll think of his name. He's a good friend of mine. And he came down to San Francisco: we were invited to a dinner one night a few years ago ... I'm getting off the track, so stop me if I wander too much, Ginny.
VS: We like to hear about the individuals.
VP: I'll have to look up his name for you, but oh, he was a charmer. It was when we were ... it must have been when I was chairman, I think ... when we were at Bailey Willis' house, and he was president of the International Club, and a charmer if I ever laid eyes on one: he was just in his twenties, and he was over here and met some American whom he said should really go to Stanford; his family was Turkish, or ­ oh, I can't remember. Anyway, his family had to get out of Turkey, and he had absolutely no money in his pocket; the American gave him enough to get to this country, and he came to Stanford. And he is now a professor at the University of Washington. I don't think he ever went back. If he did, he went back and found that he couldn't adjust to life as it was there, and he came back here. He probably gave it a try, because we encouraged him to stay on.
Oh, and then to get back to the Shimazaki: he is a professor ... no, he works for the geological survey; he is one of their top men in Japan. And he's worked all over Asia; I think he may even have gone into China and worked, I'm not sure. His wife, Yoko, is a professor at [pauses] Tokyo Women's Christian College, maybe; I've forgotten. And I've seen both of them in Japan when I've visited there. Oh, I'm very fond of them, but I forget them. If you don't keep in close touch with people they sort of go out of your
Page 7 of 14

mind for a while. [Yoshihiko Shimazaki, PhD geology 1957. Yoko Ishizaki Shimazaki was a graduate student in English, and later taught at the University of the Sacred Heart in Tokyo. She is listed as deceased in the 2012 alumni directory]
VS: Someone asked me how many students we had had in our home, and you know, it's a terrible question, and you start to think, and then, as you say, "Oh, how could I have forgotten so-and-so?" He was so much a part of our lives.
VP: Exactly. But with time, if you don't keep in close touch then ... but it's so amazing when you see them again, it's just as if you've never been apart. [tape recorder or microphone is bumped; volume drops off] Yes, it's like a close friendship with another American, you know, who's really close friends.
VS: Some college friends that you never see ...
VP: And your feeling never changes toward them at all.
VS: Do you think that these students ­ well, you had said before that they enjoyed so much coming to your home ­ that they benefitted in large part by their contacts?
[Side A ends]
[Side B begins]
VS: We were talking about students, and whether their contact with the community people made a difference in their attitudes when they go home.
VP: I don't see how it could help but make a difference, and I think that what it did was to make them admire Americans, whether they ever had before or not. I think they had great respect for the American people when they left here, because the kind of people who would step forward and offer their homes were the kind of people one would want to have them get to know. But they were people from all walks of life, too; they weren't ... we tried to avoid having only affluent homes taking them in. And so we very early set up the system of paying the person who gave them room before the dormitory opened, and if the people didn't want it, they could return it to us. But everyone was paid, so that in that way it wouldn't be a burden to anyone whose means were very limited. And that worked very well; I don't know if they do that now or not.
VS: I think they don't do it anymore.
GW: I don't think so.
VS: They particularly, I think, were trying to pay families who took in families with children, because that often could be quite a burden.
VP: Well, we felt it was a burden even if there weren't children; that, if there were two of you and you add another person on, that means you're doubling your food bill fifty percent, and we were all young then, and so I think that our own funds were limited on the whole, and those of us who were deeply in it just felt that was one gift we could make. But other people coming in from the outside very often would accept that money, and that was just fine. It went back in the coffers of the CCIS.
VS: That would be an interesting point to pursue, when that change came.
Page 8 of 14

VP: Yes, I'm curious [inaudible] but I just remember discussing that at great length, because we were afraid that it might turn out that it was only the affluent who could have them, and only older people, and we wanted them to be in all sorts of homes: young, old and medium; you know, across the board ­ and that's the way it worked out.
VS: Often the adjustment goes more smoothly if there are young children, and they ...
VP: Oh, yes!
VS: ... make the relationship more quickly.
VP: Oh, so much more easily, because I've found ... well, just like my Chinese friends, they never lived with us. I think Zheng-Min might have come over at times to stay here when his wife was gone. And one time I offered him our house when we were going to be gone for a couple of weeks, but he didn't do that; he was afraid of the responsibility. But, you know, I think that having children or young people of any age ­ with Zheng-Min, he's had our grandson around for these almost four years now, in and out, and they became good friends. So that's been a very nice thing in his relationship.
VS: It's a marvelous plus.
VP: And they love Nancy's three year old; I'm going to have to send them a tape of Willie with his mixed French and English speech. They live in Paris, you know, Nancy and Peter, and Willie ... and Zheng-Min and Ping Mei became well acquainted with Willie when he was here for three months.
VS: Did you have a lot more responsibility when Zheng-Min's wife came?
VP: Much less.
VS: Much less. Was her English good enough for her to function?
VP: She spoke beautiful English but very limited; her vocabulary was very limited. But her speech has been better than his all the way along in the sound; he never has quite gotten the hang of the way we speak, although his vocabulary is unbelievable, and has been since the very beginning. I think all selftaught, although his father went through a university in China where he had nothing but English as his language: all of his studies, all his exams were in English, all the way through. So of course Chung Min heard it at home when he was a child.
VS: Was Beijing his home?
VP: No Tian -- I never can pronounce this quite correctly ­ Tianjin; it's not terribly far from Beijing. But his father lived in Shanghai; their home originally was there. After his father's death, or maybe just before, they moved up to Tianjin, and not far from Beijing. His father was a very successful man, although he'd come from very simple people.
VS: Do you have any thoughts of other students, or other facets of this experience that you'd like to share?
VP: Only that I think it's one of the most rewarding things of my whole life. Everything I can think of, I can't think of anything that was more mutually rewarding than working with the CCIS. Because it's at a level of human relationship that one doesn't have often with people outside one's own immediate family. And it also gives one ­ I think it opens minds to different cultures, and makes one more receptive to other cultures and other ideas. And it's very hard to have prejudices when you get to know people from other countries.
Page 9 of 14

VS: That is so true. You didn't ever know of an unpleasant kind of experience with a student?
VP: Never; never once. Except the one ­ perhaps I should say there was one who took quite a lot for granted. Maybe it was the custom; I'm not even going to say what country he came from or anything else. But maybe it was because he had always had everything given to him, and he just took it for granted that life should be that way. And I didn't enjoy him as much as I did any of the other students I had. It wasn't that I wanted them to be thanking me all the time, but I felt that there should be a sense of appreciation, to Americans, for what they were doing to help. And I think one of the most fun things all the way through, and particularly if there was a wife, was to take her into your kitchen and let her help you there. Remember that, Ginny? It's such fun. They were so interested; now, for instance, my cleaning men were here this morning when Zheng-Min and Ping Mei came for me to take them to the airport, and they were so interested in knowing that it was a cleaning service, and these two men come for two hours every two weeks and they keep my house clean. And this was something completely new to them; they'd never heard of that sort of thing before. And here he's been here seven years.
VS: Isn't it interesting that he never happened to notice; he'd never encountered them before.
VP: Well, I just think it's so ... I would encourage anyone to get involved in this kind of program, and the reward goes in both directions, and it's awfully good for people's children. It's wonderful for them to grow up with other cultures so they don't have a narrow approach to life.
VS: Gertie, do you think of other questions?
GW: No, I just thought of one question: way back there when you were talking about students going home, and at one time there was some discussion, you recall, about asking governments and people who gave scholarships to build in a trip home about every second year to keep people from getting too disoriented culturally. And I wonder what difference that might have made to students you knew.
VP: I think it might have helped a bit. When they're here for a long period of time they begin to fit into our society, and I think the culture shock must be great when they go home. If they're really mature, and I think Zheng-Min is, and I think he will be able to make any kind of adjustment that's needed. But for a less mature person it must be really quite a cultural shock. Not that it's going to be worse at home, you know; not that necessarily, but it's different at home. And it's hard for them to forget what life was over here, and I think they keep comparing the two. I've talked with people in countries when, you know, after they've gone back and it takes them quite a while, I think, to work into their own society. And I think if they could go home every couple of years, and see their families, and get back into the swing of life there, it would be a lot easier.
VS: And maybe more would go home, too, particularly the stresses on the family life. I think there are not many Americans who could cope with these long absences and have a viable marriage.
VP: Oh, I don't think so either. I don't think ... yes. Imagine being left after you've been married a month and having five years, and then coming across the Pacific to be with that man you really hardly knew.
VS: I can't imagine.
VP: And leaving all your family behind. But it's ... well, they are very strong people who can do that and adjust.
VS: And they're working, feeling that the opportunity is one that they can't afford to pass up for their future life.
VP: Of course.

GW: One other thing that you might think about a little bit: in the first year of a foreign student's stay here, you remember that quite often they are depressed and what not after a few months. Even when the personal relationship has been very warm, quite often at that time you get a good deal of feeling about the materialist Americans ­ did you ever have that kind of conversation, ever, with a ...
VP: You know, I don't think I ever did; I can't think of a time, because we don't live ostentatiously, you know; we live very simply. I think Zheng-Min was surprised to find I had anybody to clean the house, because I'd been doing everything any time he's ever been here. And of course we live better than most of them do, at least from the Orient. But no, I've never had anybody: they always sort of looked at all the good things that they find here; they don't seem to be coming critically. And have you found that too, Gertie?
GW: Yes, a number of times, but mostly it would be in the office, not in the home, you know, when people would come in when they were depressed or ... and the other thing that I used to wonder how much of it there was, politically, the Imperialist American would come up every now and then, so that this euphoric feeling that most Americans have that if they meet us, they will love us, I wondered how true that is.
VP: Well, I don't know, because I guess I really was fortunate in that we never had anyone who behaved in that way. It wasn't that they would be afraid to say anything to us, because I don't think any of them were. But knowing we were a faculty family, too, you know, and they very quickly learned that faculty aren't regarded the way they are in Asia.
VS: And in most other countries. [laughs]
VP: And so that would sort of bring us to a level more approaching their own; maybe that helped too. But no, I never, I can't remember anyone ...
VS: That's nice.
VP: ... who ever criticized for that at all. But I do remember with our friend Abdul Saleem ­ and I do hope sometime he'll come back, because he really loved the United States. And when we went there he tried to show us how much the Russians were doing for them because he said, "You admit" -- that's one criticism he made ­ he said, "I don't think you Americans are willing to give the Soviets credit for the good things they're doing in the world." And he said, "We've tried to be even handed: if you build a road, we have them build a road. If they want to build something, then we ask you to build something." And he took us to show all of the things that both had done. And I'll never forget the day we went to a dam with him, because he didn't just take us on joy rides; it was on an annual inspection. He saved everything so he could do his work and at the same time take us along. And in the workings of the dam, we came across a table just covered with Marxist literature and nothing else, and so we raised our eyebrows, and Abdul said, "Yes, the Soviet Union built this dam for us;" he said, "I think I've told you that before, and they're still some Soviets here." So all of a sudden, one of them appeared, and when he found out we were Americans the expression on his face was really amusing, because he didn't expect to see any Americans in the dam where he was.
VS: In his dam.
VP: No. And I imagine he probably thought immediately of all the literature he'd put out for the Afghans to read; we collected a little bit.
VS: You mentioned you hadn't heard anything from Abdul; are there other students that the political climate might have made a difference?

VP: I don't know, because if we don't hear from a student for a while -- and I finally told Zheng-Min if I didn't hear from him for a period of, say, six months, he would not hear from me because I would feel it might be better for him not ...
VS: Don't want to be an embarrassment.
VP: Yes, exactly. And I said we had this particular friend in Afghanistan, and I didn't tell him ...
VS: Have you been able to find out anything about him?
VP: Because I can't write, and I've tried to find out through the Embassy, I've tried to find out through the State Department, and they said inquiries would be apt to cause him trouble; that he was either collaborating with the current government, or he might not be living any more, or else it was better if he was that he had no contact with Americans, by mail or inquiries or anything else. Those are the only two.
VS: You didn't have any students from Iran, or ...
VP: Yes, we did, but we've sort of lost touch with those students. We did have ­ gosh, we had an Iranian prince I remember: Naschahandan. Do you remember him? At least he said he was a prince. We always had a question in our minds. Did he ever come to your kitchen, Gertie, and cook a meal?
GW: No.
VP: He did it mostly within Earth Science[s], because that's the school that he was in. I think he was a petroleum engineer; I've forgotten. Anyway, he'd ask if he could come and cook dinner, and you knew you'd spend the next week cleaning up. [laughs] It was delicious food, but he wouldn't admit he'd never cooked anything until he got here.
GW: Yes, I think quite a few of the better financed foreign students never saw a kitchen until they got to America.
VP: And then they wanted to entertain, and so they would. Do you remember our Dean Levorsen [Levorsen, A. I. (Arville Irving), 1894-1965], our dean of Earth Sciences1? I guess it was dean of Geology, maybe, then. His wife was very fastidious and Oben used her kitchen enough in that way. She was so shocked; I'll never forget. He hadn't used mine yet, or I would have warned her. But I soon found out, too. Oh, my. Yes, we had a number of them we completely lost track of, but look, it's over thirty years.
GW?: Oh, yes. We had to.
VS: We're having a student coming on the 30th of this month that had not been back for twenty seven years.
VP: Oh, Ginny!
VS: So it was such a thrill to hear that he was coming in, from Australia.
VP: When did you get involved with the CCIS, because I can't remember after a certain point?
1 A. I. Levorsen, petroleum geologist, earned his E. M. degree at the University of Minnesota, School of Mines in 1917. He came to Stanford University in 1945 as professor of geology; he served as the first dean of the School of Mineral Sciences from 1946-51, when he left Stanford to resume his consulting career. He died in Ely, MN in July 1965.

VS: Well, I think that it was around ... I can't remember for sure, either. I think it was late `50s. Werner [Warmbrunn, the first director] had gotten Andy [Mr. Spears] to one side that he wanted to get more people involved and more families. VP: So it was through your husband rather than ... VS: I think so, yes, because our first student was a Rotary fellow that just appeared at a Rotary Club meeting, and we had him. VP: That was how it all began. VS: And Andy was best man at his wedding, it turned out. GW: I can remember Andy almost every year coming in and introducing the new Rotary students, year after year. VS: There used to be some. The year that Jeremy, the one that's coming, was here there were four that year, and ... VP: Did you have all four of them? VS: Well, we had them at the house, and our first house exchange in England four or five years ago was with one of those students. VP: Was it? VS: and so, you know, one does keep up. VP: Of course one does. VS: Just a few. VP: And how did you get involved? GW: Well [tape pauses] VS: Well, we do thank you for your time, and all your efforts in recalling wonderful experiences. We'll hope that if you think of something you want to add, we'll give you an opportunity to do so. VP: Thank you, Ginny; I really enjoyed this, very much. [Side B ends]
