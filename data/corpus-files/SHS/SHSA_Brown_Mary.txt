ALUMNI STORIES, CLASS OF 1957
INTERVIEWER: SARAH WHEELOCK
SUBJECT: MARY SIMMONS BROWN
DATE: 13 OCTOBER 2007
WHEELOCK: So today is October 13th, I think.
BROWN: October the 13th.
WHEELOCK: I’m Sarah Wheelock, and I am doing this interview as part of alumni
stories for the class of ‘57 and today I am talking with…
BROWN: Mary Karen Simmons Brown, and I grew up in Los Angeles. And my father,
who was born in 1889, went to Stanford for one year in 1908, two years after the San
Francisco fire. And unfortunately he had an illness when, he was from Minnesota, and he
went back after the first year and couldn’t return. But he later, in 1926, I think, he moved
to Los Angeles and met my mother, and growing up I always heard this lore about
Stanford. And when we would come on vacations occasionally to Lake Tahoe, we’d
come by San Francisco and we’d come by the campus. So, I had this kind of desire to go
to Stanford, from my very earliest years. And I went to Hamilton High School, a public
high school in Los Angeles and we were one of the last classes to graduate in the middle
of the year, so I graduated in February of 1953. And one of my best friends and I wanted
to go to Stanford and so we had submitted applications. And I remember waiting for that
letter and, we both were admitted fortunately and, we’re both here today at our fiftieth
reunion.
WHEELOCK: Really? How nice.

BROWN: And I lived in Roble and two years in Lagunita and one year in Florence
Moore and it was its first year. And I came down to the fiftieth reunion on a train from
Seattle, where I’ve lived since 1978 and I just happened to sit next to a young man who
was coming down for his fifth reunion, and he said he lived in Florence Moore, which is
now some of the units, I guess, are coed. So that was interesting. What traditions do I
remember? Well I remember the Gaieties and I remember that—I can’t think of her name
right now, but the—they presented the musical Anything Goes, in my freshman year, and
this woman had a fabulous voice, kind of like Ethel Merman, you know, really powerful
voice, and she had the lead.
WHEELOCK: Wow.
BROWN: And I loved going to the football games and I’m going today and it always
seemed to me, I went to some football games in the Coliseum in L.A., growing up and
every five to ten years, Stanford would have this incredible victory just like last weekend
when they beat USC in the Coliseum. So it’ll be fun to go to a football game. I lived in
Roble with Ann Chase and Joyce Johnson were my roommates my freshman year, we
lived on 3A and we had one of those triples, I don’t know whether—is Roble still a
dorm?
WHEELOCK: Yeah.
BROWN: Yeah, yeah. So I majored in speech and drama. And I think, some of my
most memorable classes were Shakespeare from Marge Bailey. [BAILEY, MARGERY,
Professor of English. A.B.,Stanford, 1914, A.M., 1916; Ph.D., Yale, 1922. At Stanford
since 1914] And I took an Intellectual History of Europe class that I really loved and I
can’t remember the professor now. And I took three classes at the Knoll; I was not a
music major, but I took three classes from Sandor Salgo, [SALGO, SANDOR, Associate
Professor of Music. 534 Lasuen, Stanford. Allami Muveszi Oklevel, Royal Hungarian
Academy of Music, 1928. At Stanford since 1949] who taught just “Introduction to
Music” and then “Symphony” and “Concerto” and I remember those classes to this day.

And he had this vibrancy about him, infectious love of music that he communicated to
the student and, he was—as I recall, the head of the, director of the Carmel Bach Festival
at that time.
WHEELOCK: Ah, wow.
BROWN: I would walk from the Knoll back to Lagunita when I lived there in my
sophomore and junior year and there was this kind of short cut. And the only bad thing
that ever happened—that fortunately wasn’t the bad thing, but I was walking back from a
class at the Knoll and taken this short cut and this—I don’t know how old he was, this
man started to chase me and fortunately I got—made it back to the entrance of Lagunita.
WHEELOCK: Oh, how horrible!
BROWN: But that was a little scary. Um …
WHEELOCK: That is very scary.
BROWN: That was the—anyway, and my freshman year, we were coming back from, I
think, a basketball game before they had this beautiful Mapes [i.e., Maples] Pavilion, you
know, and we were walking through the courtyard there at the student union, the old
student union. And it had this fountain in it, and we had lost the game, and this was the
only, I mean, the only really ridiculous thing, that I can recall doing, I hadn’t—we hadn’t
been drinking or anything, but I was so upset, I thought, I’m going to jump in the
fountain. I jumped in the fountain and discovered it’s only about knee deep. [laughs] I
had no idea it was so shallow.
WHEELOCK: They’ve redone it and you can tell, now, how deep it is.
BROWN: Oh, is it—yeah, before you couldn’t. I haven’t … I was here for my fortieth
reunion ten years ago and we went up—upper, by then. I haven’t been up that far …

WHEELOCK: They just reopened the old union …
BROWN: Oh, oh really?
WHEELOCK: ...like a few weeks ago, so it’s amazing and…
BROWN: Oh, wow.
WHEELOCK: I think you would really get a kick out of it.
BROWN: Maybe tomorrow, because I plan to go to the memorial service.
WHEELOCK: Oh, yeah, yeah, that would be—that’d be a nice thing to tie in, yeah. It’s
—it looks—it’s beautiful and the fountain is beautiful too. And you can jump in it.
BROWN: Well I don’t think I—I will, but…
WHEELOCK: At halftime.
BROWN: You know, I would say that one of the things I took away from my Stanford
education is an intense curiosity about the world and a lifelong desire to learn. And my
husband’s maternal ancestors came from the Basque country; he grew up in Elko,
Nevada, and we were married in 1965 [sic] and went to live in the Spanish Basque
country and we lived there on and off for ten years. And then—so I kind of did what he
wanted to. He was painting at that time and I taught English. But then when I came back
in 1956 [i.e., 1976?] I went to seminary at Claremont School of Theology and became a
United Methodist minister, which had been a kind of a lifelong goal. But I haven’t been,
you know, my daughter graduated from high school and it was kind of then or never and
my husband was very supportive. So—and then—now I’m involved and in retirement, in
something called Awakening the Dream or Changing the Dream, [Awakening the

4

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARY BROWN

Dreamer Initiative] which is a symposium sponsored by the Pachamama Alliance , which
is centered in the Bay Area and San Francisco. And it’s to help people, uh, realize that
we can have an environmentally sustainable, spiritually fulfilling, and socially just human
presence on the earth. And so there’re twenty-four people that were trained in the Puget
Sound area and we’re trying to get this symposium out to as many contacts as possible.
But it kind of ties in with all of the discussion at the round table this morning, which to
me was worth all of the effort of getting here. It was fabulous, I thought. And the whole
—I mean I think the—the number one world security issue is, you know, the
environment, so.
WHEELOCK: Was that something that maybe not so much the environment, because
that wouldn’t have been a topic then, but was, you know, of social issues and that sort of
thing, something that you started thinking about when you were here at Stanford or …?
BROWN: Well, maybe, you know, I’ve just been interested in those social issues and I
think the Intellectual History of Europe class, you know, tied into those yearnings. But I
just feel that I—I feel that somehow the gifts that I’ve been given have, I’ve been—used
them in my life and then certain events happened that they, kind of, funnel into this new
event or life, I mean, the ability finally to realize the dream of being a minister. And as
an eight year old, when I first had that kind of inclination that there weren’t any -- I didn’t
have any female role models, yeah…
WHEELOCK: Of course not, yeah.
BROWN: And then later when we came back from Spain and moved to Seattle because
I didn’t want to live in Nevada and my husband didn’t want to live in California, we had
mutual friends in the Seattle area. I went to a Methodist church that had a young woman
as its pastor and she became kind of a mentor and that—and that rekindled all of that
desire to go into the ministry. But everything that had come before, also, funneled into
that. And then since my husband died and I went back to work part-time as a chaplain
and then became involved in something called Earth Ministry in the Seattle area, which is

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARY BROWN

called—which is helping congregations live more gently on the earth. Then through that
interest, I found out about this seminar…
WHEELOCK: Oh, I see, yeah.
BROWN: …and I say it to all of these things, I think one of the keys to living a blessed
life, is always being open to what new is calling you, you know. So I’m very grateful for
my Stanford education.
WHEELOCK: Excellent. Did you—do you remember going to anything, any services
in Memorial Church…
BROWN: Oh yes, I do, uh-huh. And I always, you know, it’s such an incredibly
beautiful building and hearing the organ. So I’m looking forward to going to the
memorial service tomorrow.
WHEELOCK: Yeah, it’s a wonderful church. I just you know, since I’m here on
campus a lot, of course, I get to, you know, wander through it at odd times and if you’re
lucky, you can hear the organist practicing.
BROWN: Oh, oh, wow, yeah. So are you a grad—a Stanford grad?
WHEELOCK: Well, actually I’m a Berkeley grad.
BROWN: Oh, okay.
WHEELOCK: But, um, but yeah, Stanford has such interesting things connected with it
and, you know, so many people, I think, have, kind of, found, you know, taken that time
when they were in, you know, their late teens and early twenties and really looked back
on them and said, “You know, I can really see that it was you know, my experiences of,
you know, growing up. And the new things I had to encounter that really, you know,

6

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARY BROWN

opened me to—to things that happened later.” I think it’s really—it’s really a gift to be
able to have experiences.
BROWN: Absolutely. Oh, and I remember—John Brodie was the football quarterback
when I was, during my years, so, we had some—some good wins and some painful
losses, but it was fun.
WHEELOCK: That’s excellent. Did you—you went to all the games when you were
here or…
BROWN: I think so, most of them, uh huh. So I’ll be interested to see the new stadium
may—because I remember the old stadium, you know, and seated a hundred thousand,
but—and you could stomp on the wooden, benches and …
WHEELOCK: Yeah, you could pretty much hear that racket in Menlo Park.
BROWN: Yeah. Like I said, it’s not feasible in the new stadium.
WHEELOCK: I think that, you know, the crowds will be able to make noise to make it
worth while. So, anything else in particular that you remember; any particular classes
or…
BROWN: I was a—a speech and drama major, but I specialized in radio, TV, film.
WHEELOCK: Did you?
BROWN: And then I went to the San Francisco State for their radio, TV, film.
WHEELOCK: Oh, really?

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARY BROWN

BROWN: Uh huh, and I was thinking—and then I went back to Los Angeles and was
hoping to get a job in—oh, I know, I have it backwards. After I graduated from here, I
went back and couldn’t seem to find—I wanted—was interested in educational TV…
WHEELOCK: Oh, yes, yeah.
BROWN: …and I couldn’t seem to find a job so then I went—you know, that was
women weren’t really terribly involved, so then I went to San Francisco State to work
towards a master’s degree in radio, TV, film. And that’s when I met my husband on a
Sierra Club hike…
WHEELOCK: Oh, really.
BROWN: …and, uh, he was working towards a PhD in anthropology and as it turned
out, he didn’t finish his—he had a master’s but he didn’t finish his PhD and I didn’t finish
my master’s in radio, TV, film because we ended up getting married and going to Spain.
WHEELOCK: Not such a bad bargain.
BROWN: Not so bad. Oh, dear, so that was sort of, kind of, my memories of Stanford
that started from my father being here in 1908.
WHEELOCK: That’s right. And it’s funny to think that you made that—your father
was here and then you were here in the time when, you know, women are sort of
encouraged to do different—different majors than that perhaps they would’ve wanted to
and you couldn’t wear skirts on the Quad. And so now you’re back here, you’re a
minister, something that wouldn’t have been possible [talking at same time] either and
yeah. It’s great how much, you know, things change and…
BROWN: Oh, it’s amazing, things change but there’s always that future luring us on.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARY BROWN

WHEELOCK: Yeah, that’s right; I always have to be open to new things, like you said.
BROWN: Well thank you! Was that it?
WHEELOCK: Well thank you so much for coming, yes, I appreciate it.
