Introduction
This oral history was conducted by the Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program in
collaboration with the Stanford University Archives. The program is under the direction of
the Oral History Committee of the Stanford Historical Society.
The Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program furthers the Society’s mission “to
foster and support the documentation, study, publication, dissemination, and preservation of
the history of the Leland Stanford Junior University.” The program explores the institutional
history of the University, with an emphasis on the transformative post-WWII period,
through interviews with leading faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and others. The interview
recordings and transcripts provide valuable additions to the existing collection of written and
photographic materials in the Stanford University Archives.
Oral history is not a final, verified, or complete narrative of events. It is a unique, reflective,
spoken account, offered by the interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it may be
deeply personal. Each oral history is a reflection of the past as the interviewee remembers
and recounts it. But memory and meaning vary from person to person; others may recall
events differently. Used as primary source material, any one oral history will be compared
with and evaluated in light of other evidence, such as contemporary texts and other oral
histories, in arriving at an interpretation of the past. Although the interviewees have a past or
current connection with Stanford University, they are not speaking as representatives of the
University.
Each transcript is edited by program staff and by the interviewee for grammar, syntax, and
occasional inaccuracies and to aid in overall clarity and readability--but is not fact-checked as
such. The approach is to maintain the substantive content of the interview as well as the
interviewee’s voice. As a result of this editing process, the transcript may not match the
recording verbatim. If a substantive deletion has been made, this is generally indicated at the
relevant place on the transcript. Substantive additions are noted in brackets or by footnote.

Abstract
In this oral history, Jane Collier, professor of cultural and social anthropology, emerita,
discusses her family background, her undergraduate and graduate education in anthropology,
and her field work in Chiapas, Mexico. She also describes the growth of feminist thought
and activity at Stanford University and reflects on change over time in the Department of
Anthropology at Stanford and in the field of cultural anthropology more generally. In an
accompanying written biography, Collier describes her research and teaching interests.
With her father in the foreign service, Collier’s childhood was lived in five countries and
three languages, and she recalls always feeling like the odd person out, especially in a
missionary school where she was the only student who had not been “saved.” At the time,
Collier explains, women’s work was generally defined as caring for a family, and she
remembers often wanting to be a boy.
Gender expectations thwarted her desire to be a Mayan archaeologist, she points out, leading
her to study anthropology at Radcliffe College. A life-changing course on South America
introduced her to the late Professor Evon Z. Vogt, her longtime mentor. Summers with his
student team in Chiapas, Mexico, generate rich anecdotes about her work on the role of
women in Zinatancan households and her courtship with George Collier. Soon she and
George were married with two children, and Collier describes how they balanced childcare
with scholarly pursuits.
Following George to Stanford’s Department of Anthropology, she tells how she became
part of an informal collective of women anthropologists including the late Michelle (Shelly)
Rosaldo. While prevailing anthropological thinking in 1971 circumscribed women as family
caregivers, Collier explains, the collective’s ethnographic reading showed that women held
various roles, often involving power but rarely prestige. One outcome was a course entitled
“Women in Cross-Cultural Perspective.” Collier also describes the exciting atmosphere at
Stanford’s Center for Research on Women (CROW) where women faculty members from a
variety of disciplines discussed research involving gender.

9

As a teacher, Collier acknowledges an ongoing challenge when women students accepted
biological determinism’s consignment of women to maternal roles. She discusses her own
experience combining motherhood with an academic career, highlighting the positive
influence of then Department Chair Benjamin D. Paul, who hired Rosaldo and Collier as the
department’s first tenure-track women.
Recalling the Faculty Senate’s review of Stanford’s “Western Civ” requirement, Collier
describes a unique and diverse course sequence developed by the Department of
Anthropology. While students liked the new focus, she says, their families often supported
the traditional view. She also discusses an investigation she led into the ethics of a graduate
student’s activity in China.
As the twentieth century neared an end, Collier experienced conflicts within the Department
of Anthropology over approaches based on biology versus culture, as well as a generational
division among cultural anthropologists. Before the 1960s, she says, the focus was on what
kept societies stable, while later research turned to power and its uneven distribution. As
“the kind of anthropology I loved was going out of fashion,” she discusses leaving campus
for fieldwork and eventually taking early retirement.

Jane Fishburne Collier
Biography
Because the oral interviews focused on my family and educational history, as well as my
administrative experiences at Stanford, I want to use this written biography to describe my
research and teaching interests. Throughout my career, I have focused on three areas within
Cultural Anthropology: legal anthropology, kinship-family-gender, and the history of
anthropological theory.
I began my career with an interest in how people in different societies think about, and try to
settle, the conflicts that arise in daily life. My Tulane dissertation focused on legal processes
in Zinacantan, Chiapas, Mexico (Collier 1972). In comparing Zincanteco legal procedures
with those reported elsewhere, I came to realize that people living in differently organized
societies experience conflicts differently.
When collaborating with Shelly Rosaldo teaching the course on “Sex Roles and Society,” we
realized that conflicts over women in what have been characterized as the “simplest” human
societies (hunter-gatherers and simple horticulturalists) were actually conflicts over whether a
man was capable of defending what he claimed as his. Not surprisingly, men in such
societies placed few claims, given that any sensible man did not want to spend his life
fighting. Wives, however, were worth fighting over, because it was by having a wife that a
man was able to claim independence from other men. Bachelors, who lacked wives to cook
daily food, had to provide for themselves or beg food from a man with a wife. Given that
men in such “simple” societies apparently “earned” their wives by working for in-laws, it is
little wonder that a husband physically confronted any man who tried to “take his wife”. In
contrast, in somewhat more “complex” societies where elders exchanged “valuables” to
validate marriages, men commonly took disputes over women to respected leaders who
convened moots to negotiate compromise solutions involving exchanges of goods. Shelly
and I published our findings in an article titled “Politics and Gender in Simple Societies
(Collier and Rosaldo 1981). I later went on to explore how different forms of validating
marriages in societies based on kinship shaped not only what people fought over and how

11

they settled disputes, but other aspects of social living and beliefs (see Marriage and Inequality
in Classless Societies, J. Collier 1988).
When hired by Stanford in the early 1970’s, I was fortunate to participate in the exciting new
field of feminist anthropology. Heeding the feminist insight that “the personal is political,”
anthropologists interested in studying women’s political roles and men’s family roles soon
realized that the conceptual distinction between the politico-jural domain and the kinshipgender domain needed rethinking. Before the 1970s, anthropologists studying social groups
lacking organized police forces and armies had argued that kinship--i.e., socially recognized
rules about marriage and descent as determined and upheld by men with authority-performed the crucial function of preserving social order. Kinship, based on social rules, was
thus imagined as distinct from intimate family relationships based on biological necessity.
But even as feminist anthropologists convincingly argued against using the public/privatepolitical/family conceptual distinction as an analytical tool, most (including Shelly and me)
continued to believe that women’s apparently universal secondary status reflected women’s
biological capacity to bear children.
Over time, however, Shelly and I came to realize that peoples’ understandings of gender
could not be understood as a direct representation of biological differences or even as a
representation of what men and women did. Rather ,we argued, “gender conceptions must
be seen as aspects of cultural systems through which people understand, manipulate,
rationalize, resist and reproduce relations of inequality within complex social wholes”
(Collier 1997:70). Shelly and I therefore started to argue against feminist scholars who
imagined that ideas of gender universally reflect obvious differences between men and
women (such as those between men as life-takers and women as life-givers, male hunters
and female gatherers, or male producers and female reproducers). Because our analyses of
the “simplest” human societies revealed that hunter-gatherers lacked notions of women as
either life-givers or as gatherers (even as men were celebrated as hunters who both killed and
gave life), we asked why. An obvious answer was that in societies where men strove to show
they were capable of defending what they claimed as theirs, people had little reason to talk
about the characteristics of the women men fought over. The one thing that mattered about
women was their supposed “sexual” desirability to men. Shelly and I then discovered-12

somewhat to our surprise--that women’s rituals in those few “simple” societies where
women held rituals apart from men were indeed celebrations of their sexual prowess.
Because Shelly and I discussed many different types of societies in our joint course on “Sex
Roles and Society,” we came to realize that ideas about the “natures” of men and women
not only varied far more than commonly imagined but, as noted earlier, reflected cultural
ideas about social inequality. Instead of imagining that biological differences determined
ideas of gender, we reversed the causal arrow to explore how cultural conceptions of gender,
as shaped by social processes, determined which biological differences made a difference in
men’s and women’s life trajectories. Moreover, I gradually came to believe that the
“handicaps” thought to prevent women from achieving the prestige and authority enjoyed
by men reflected less women’s abilities than the “faults” said to prevent some men from
achieving the “success” enjoyed by other men. Among hunter-gatherers, for example, where
“great hunters” enjoyed prestige and multiple wives, women “couldn’t” hunt (even though
ethnographic evidence suggests that women often killed many animals). Women’s
“problem,” of course, was that women could not acquire the wives that men claimed to
obtain and defend by hunting. I thus came to realize that instead of “great hunters”
acquiring wives, men who had wives had to spend time hunting in order to demonstrate the
physical prowess needed to deter other men from trying to steal their wives. So, in addition
to reversing the causal arrow between relevant biological differences and social processes, I
started to reverse the causal arrow between male success and the behaviors and capacities
credited with making men successful. I thus continued the process of trying to understand
different ways of organizing social inequality that I had begun with Shelly before her tragic
death in 1981.
When writing about the changes I observed in a small Spanish village between the 1960s and
the 1980s (Collier 1997), I focused on how differences in the organization of social
inequality shaped people’s ideas about men and women as well as how villagers went about
managing relationships within families. In the 1960s, when the amount of land a couple
inherited determined their occupations, power and prestige, women’s ability to bring
bastards into the family--and so confuse lines of inheritance--was the most important aspect
of their biology. Both men and women focused on, and attempted to control, women’s

13

chastity. In the 1980s, by contrast, when a couple’s occupations, wealth, and prestige were
determined by what kinds of paying jobs they held, women’s trouble finding employers who
would allow them to care for infants, young children and elders while doing paid work,
turned mothers into economic dependents of male earners. Instead of women’s supposed
“openness” to “penetration” by adulterers (so feared by villagers in the 1960s), women’s
“problem” in the 1980s was that their bodies and minds were “designed” for birthing babies.
Supposedly preoccupied by “selflessly” caring for their families, women were imagined to
lack the self-interested drive and competitiveness that high earners claimed determined their
successes and fortunes.
Finally, as an anthropologist interested in comparing cultures around the world, I had to
analyze the conceptual frameworks used by ethnographers who gathered the data I needed
for making comparisons. For example, it made sense for ethnographers studying Spanish
villages in the 1950s to focus on the shared cultural values that might reconcile people after
years of war. By the 1980s, in contrast, both ethnographers like me and the villagers I
interviewed were wondering how people living in the modern world could ever have been so
preoccupied by women’s chastity. Once I began to teach the introductory graduate course
on the “History of Anthropological Theory,” I acquired collaborators -- wonderful students
and colleagues who shared my interest in analyzing the historically determined concerns that
shaped the questions anthropologists asked thus affected the answers they found (see
Collier, Maurer and Suarez-Navaz 1995).
As I think back over my career, I realize that I will always be grateful to Stanford University
for providing me with the colleagues and opportunities that enabled me to pursue the
research questions I cared about.

INTERVIEWEE:

JANE COLLIER

INTERVIEWER:

ALICIA TORRE

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

NOVEMBER 15, 2016

Torre: This is Alicia Torre with the Stanford Historical Society’s Oral History
program. I am here today, November 15th, 2016, at the Oakland, California
home of Stanford University’s Jane Collier, emerita professor of cultural and
social anthropology. We are conducting this interview as part of the
Stanford Pioneering Women Oral History Project.
To start out, Jane, can you tell me a little about your parents, their
occupations, and your upbringing?
Collier: My family is from South Carolina. My father was one of ten children. At the
end of the war, I guess he wanted to join the Foreign Service. I was born in
Charleston in 1940. I have an older brother who was born in 1937. And so
that family of four. My father wanted to join the Foreign Service. I’m not
sure--on some kind of temporary basis in 1944, before the war ended--he
was sent to the Canary Islands because the Canaries were apparently a
stopping off point for American soldiers going back and forth to Africa. In
1944, we moved to the Canary Islands. My parents, my brother, and my
grandmother, who was widowed, my mother’s mother, came with us.

15

And we lived first on the island of Grand Canaria in the city of Las
Palmas. I was four years old. I think there I was put into a preschool. We
were there from 1944 to 1946. I guess in 1945 we moved to the island of
Tenerife so that we were on two different islands.
[00:02:13] My brother and I were put into Spanish school. It was a
school run by nuns. So apparently according to my mother both my brother
and I spoke Spanish to one another. [laughs] Then in 1946, my father went
home to take the Foreign Service exam, leaving my mother, my
grandmother, and the two little kids at home in the Canary Islands in 1946.
And my mother had to get us home from the Canaries in 1946.
I guess we had to go through Spain since the Canaries belonged to
Spain. And Spain, of course, was a mess in 1946. Well, all of Europe was a
mess in 1946. And the Spanish train system didn’t hook up with the French
train system. [laughs] We were supposed to fly out of Paris to fly home.
[00:03:08] We ended up in Paris, and my poor mother had no money,
no nothing. And the flights were problematic. But apparently the embassy in
Paris got first my grandmother and my brother on a flight home from Paris
to New York. My mother and I were stuck with no money, no food, no
clothes [laughs] in Paris for apparently another couple of days and then
finally got the plane home.
In those days it was the Pan-Am 12-hour flight. I was six years old.
My mother remembers that I rolled a can of Klim, which was that powdered
milk which was what we ate, down the aisle. It was open. [laughs]
Apparently down the aisle of this poor plane. We made it back.

16

[00:03:57] Between my father’s postings we would go to South
Carolina and stay with--actually, my mother had a dear friend in South
Carolina in Charleston. So there we would stay. My father passed the
Foreign Service exam and entered the Foreign Service formally. He was sent
to Medellín, Colombia. I don’t know why they had a consulate in Medellín,
Colombia because Bogotá is the capital of Colombia.
But in Medellín was 1946 to 1948. I don’t think I had learned how to
read. My parents were actually quite worried about me because I seemed to
be backward. They put me in a school that was in English, and I learned to
read very fast. After that, I was a great reader and I basically read [laughs]
and read and read all through my childhood.
[00:04:57] After Medellín in 1948 my father was transferred to
Antwerp, Belgium. Again, there was a consulate in Antwerp, I guess because
it was a very busy port, even though Brussels is the capital of Belgium. We
moved to Belgium in 1948. I was put into a French school--dumped into
[laughs] French school, where they put me in third grade.
At the end of the school year there in this College Marie Jose, it was
called, their graduation ceremony was called distribucion de pris, the
distribution of prizes, where they lined up all the little girls at the girls’
school--all the little girls on the basis of their grades. I was, of course, at the
end of the line. [laughs] The two people below me failed the class. I passed
it. But [laughs] the others failed.
[00:06:05] We were there for three years. By the end of those three
years I was basically bilingual in French and did okay.

17

Torre: Your parents must have valued language that they put you into the native
language schools rather than into English.
Collier: There weren’t any English schools.
Torre: Not a choice.
Collier: Not a choice. My brother was also in a French school. Both of us were in
French-speaking schools. In 1951, we came back to the United States. My
father got sent to the University of Chicago to study economics so that he
could be part of the economics section of the embassies and so on. He went
to the University of Chicago for a year, and my brother and I were put in
the Laboratory School in Chicago.
[00:07:09] In Belgium I did the third, fourth, and fifth grade. But
when I came to Chicago, they put me in the seventh grade. They gave me an
IQ test which consisted of all of these cultural questions like, “How many
men on a baseball team?” I hadn’t a clue since I’d [laugh] never played
baseball. That year in Chicago was actually quite hard because in the Foreign
Service there’s extra money, and you get to have a nice house and a servant
and so on.
In Chicago, all of that extra money goes away. And my family was
always relatively poor. They would go into debt every time they had to move
because of the moving expenses. We lived in this miserable apartment
where I had to share a room with my grandmother in South Chicago. My
grandmother was assaulted outside our front door. The South side of
Chicago is a very bad neighborhood.

18

[00:08:12] I was barely allowed outside and things. So that was a very
difficult year. That was actually the first time I ever saw television because
we had never had television before. After Chicago he was sent to
Washington, DC, for two years in the State Department. I did eighth and
ninth grades. We lived in Arlington, Virginia. I was in an Arlington, Virginia
high school. I don’t remember very much about it, but it was basically fine
and English. Then he was sent to Ecuador, which must have been 1954 or
1955, to Quito, Ecuador.
[00:09:07] In Quito, they first put me into what was called the
Ecuadorian American School, which was basically Ecuadorian and in
Spanish. I couldn’t take it because my experience was that everybody
cheated because [laughs] they would copy off each other’s papers. The
homework that was due, one person would do it, and everybody else would
copy it. It was the sort of cultural way of doing things, but I couldn’t take it.
Torre: Very cooperative but not competitive.
Collier: [laughs] Yes.
Torre: Different culture.
Collier: Different culture. My parents then put me into a school that was run for the
children of American missionaries, Evangelical missionaries. It was a
boarding school for the children of missionaries who were working in Peru
and Ecuador and Colombia.
[00:10:05] Actually, it was wonderful for me. I had a wonderful high
school. I did ninth, tenth--no. I did tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades there.
Because I came in in the middle of the year, I had to make up all the

19

beginning of work, the tenth grade. Actually, I loved it. I got some help, but
I loved studying on my own.
Even though I never got “saved,” which meant that my principal
would not write me recommendations when I applied to college, [laughs]
most of the Evangelicals were lovely people. There was no drinking, no
smoking, no dancing, no movies.
[00:11:00] It was a basically very good experience for me. I got a good
education. It was what enabled me to go to college in the US.
Torre: Was that a girls’ school?
Collier: No.
Torre: It was co-ed.
Collier: A co-ed school.
Torre: Did you board, or were you a day student?
Collier: I was a day student because it was in Quito. There were a few day students.
There were some other kids from the embassy there. But most of them
were the children of Evangelical missionaries.
Torre: So tell me. What were your parents’ and, importantly, your grandmother’s
expectation for you and your brother? What were their attitudes towards
marriage and motherhood and women working?
Collier: [laughs] When we were living in Belgium, I have this memory--my
grandmother was living with us then--that my brother and I were with her.
And we asked her what would we be when we grew up.
[00:12:03] She told my brother that he was going to be a great doctor
like her dead husband had been a doctor, and that he was going to do

20

wonderful work as a doctor. I said, “What I am going to be?” My
grandmother said, “You’re going to make some man very, very happy.”
[laughs] But that was my grandmother, who was that generation. My
mother, and particularly when we were in Quito and I was in high school,
was always very strongly, “You have to have a life that’s more than taking
care of little children.”
I think for my mother it had been very important to be in the
Foreign Service because she always had a role to play. A lot of it was hosting
parties and so on but also sort of joining the organizations of women in
these countries. She always made a great effort to learn about the countries,
to learn languages, to sort of keep herself intellectually alive.
[00:13:08] Many women of her generation that came of age in the
post war had a really hard time--the women that Betty Friedan wrote about.
My mother avoided that by being really very active and participating in the
life of the Foreign Service. When she was in Washington, she in fact worked
for the Foreign Service magazine and stuff like that. My mother was a
different generation. My mother was, “Yes, get married and have children,
but don’t let that be your whole life.”
That was my mother. Actually, all through high school my mother
was very much sort of encouraging me to read and so on.
Torre: Who did you admire as a youngster? Did you have any female role models
that had careers?
Collier: [00:14:07] No. [laughs] No, no, no.
Torre: Did you have any figures you admired in literature or history?

21

Collier: No. I wanted to be a scientist, but one of my big problems was when I
moved to Ecuador, I guess I’d had first year algebra in ninth grade. In tenth
grade I got geometry, and I desperately wanted to go on in math because I
loved math. But there wasn’t any second-year algebra course. I tried to teach
myself second-year algebra, but I got stuck. And nobody could help me, so I
had to drop math. That was sad. I had wanted to be into science and was
sorry not to go on in math because I had always loved math.
[00:15:06] The thing I did read when I was there was--that’s what got
me interested in archeology. I was reading books about--I guess because my
history course had had early history, and I fell in love with Sumer and Ur
and the Hittites and all of that kind of stuff.
Torre: This is when you were in Belgium?
Collier: No. This was when I was in high school.
Torre: When you were at the Evangelical-Collier: Evangelical high school.
Torre: Missionary school
Collier: Missionary school. Yes.
Torre: Were there particular teachers there that helped that interest? Or was it just
that you on your own had started to read?
Collier: In a sense I did have a wonderful teacher, who was the high school teacher.
My class was five people. [laughs] Our high school was what? Maybe thirty
or forty with all of the classes.
[00:16:03] We did have a wonderful teacher. As I told you, I had to
come in in the tenth grade halfway through class. World history was what

22

they were supposed to be doing. I had to do the beginning of world history
on my own, and that was when I started all this interest in early civilizations.
The teacher must have encouraged me. He was called Mr. Prentice.
He was a very good person. Actually, he left [laughs] the Evangelical Church
shortly after I graduated, I think. Truly, I met some wonderful Evangelicals,
too. Although, at the end, the principal of the school was somebody who
was one of those Evangelicals who knew what God thought on every single
subject and told you. He was the one who would not write
recommendations for me because I had not been “Saved.”
Torre: [00:17:00] Some high school principals do run to be very sure of things.
Collier: [laughs] Yes.
Torre: [laughs]
Collier: And this one had a direct line to God. [laughs]
Torre: [laughs] Were you ever in trouble or called into the dean’s office because of
not being religious?
Collier: I wasn’t called into the dean’s office. No. I don’t know if I had told you this
before. The one sort of really bad experience was in tenth grade when I was
new there. I did sort of really want to be “Saved.” Everybody else had been
saved. But I couldn’t ever quite bring myself to it. They had a “revival
meeting,” in quotes there, where for a week somebody would come and sort
of preach hellfire and damnation and what would happen to you if you
hadn’t accepted God and so on. At the end of the week, the minister who
was doing it sort of had us all on our knees and praying and then sort of
announced: [00:18:04] “Now, those of you who would like to be saved,

23

stand up and come forward.” There was a sort of a rustle, rustle, rustle.
Some people got up and came forward. The rest of us stayed kneeling. Then
the minister, who welcomed these people, and then he said, “Now, those of
you who have been saved, stand up.” There was a huge rustle, rustle, rustle.
Lots of people stood up.
Then he said, “Now that we’re all standing, let’s sing a hymn.” I was
the only person in that room who had to stand up. [laughs]
Torre: Did any of your classmates comment on that? Or was it just you who felt it?
Collier: It was just me who felt it. No, actually, my classmates were really very nice
to me. But that was a pretty traumatic moment for me. [laughs]
Torre: If you had stood up just to keep your cover as it were, would you have felt
like a terrible hypocrite internally? Or also would you have felt bad to your
family, who were not Evangelicals? What kept you on your knees when
some people would just-Collier: [00:19:15] I was a total, little innocent. I did what I was told. [laughs]
Torre: [laughs] Well, listening to those experiences, it seems to me that you got
used at different times in your life to being the different person. That may
have stood you well in being an early female professor, that you were used
to being different than the rest of the people around you.
Collier: That’s an interesting thought. I hadn’t thought about it that way. But that’s
certainly true, because in Belgium I was much the largest child. Because of
course, all my little classmates had suffered through the war in Belgium and
the hunger. And I was also an American and a well-fed American, so I was
much bigger than any of the little kids in my class in Belgium.

24

Torre: [00:20:11] Do you feel good about being bigger? Or did you feel
embarrassed?
Collier: No. It was terrible. I couldn’t play jump rope with them because their jump
ropes wouldn’t fit me. [laughs] Yes. No, no. It was hard in that kind of way
being the biggest one around.
Torre: When you came back to Chicago, of course, you didn’t know popular
culture.
Collier: Didn’t know popular culture. That was also true for our stay in Washington.
In Washington, my family didn’t have a television. Everybody else had
television. I would babysit to go watch television. But when all of my
classmates talked about what they were seeing on television, I couldn’t
participate. So you’re right. I was always sort of the odd person out in those
kinds of things.
Torre: And did that bother you then? Or was it just something you’d gotten used
to because of moving around, and that’s sort of what life was like when you
were a State Department child?
Collier: [00:21:04] I don’t remember being unhappy or anything. I always had one or
two friends, and I always had books. So I don’t remember being unhappy.
Torre: Tell me about your growing interest in archaeology. Here you were in
Ecuador. Did you go see ruins?
Collier: No. I actually don’t remember seeing any ruins [laughs] in Ecuador, even
though there must have been some Inca ruins running around. What I was
really interested in then was those early civilizations kind of thing, which
were all, of course, European. What it did mean--

25

Torre: [phone rings; interruption] You were saying that you were interested in the
early European--Mesopotamian.
Collier: Yes. Civilizations. Yes. I should tell you, my brother wasn’t with us in
Ecuador, nor was my grandmother. My grandmother went back to live in
Charleston. My brother, after the time in the Lab School in Chicago, they
sent him to prep school at Lawrenceville. Then he went on to Princeton. My
brother wasn’t with us, so I was the only child. After Chicago, actually, both
in Washington, DC. and then in Ecuador I was sort of the only child. And
my grandmother was no longer with us.
Torre: [00:23:05] Now, I am curious about that. The boy got sent to boarding
school in the States, and you were kept with your parents.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: Is that because they were more concerned about his education or more
protective of you physically as a girl? Or just because they wanted you with
them? They didn’t want to be alone?
Collier: [laughs] No. My experience was always that the boy was going to have the
career, and he did the education and so on. It was nice for me to have
things, but it was very clear that my brother was the one who was going to
have to have the education. Actually, all through my childhood when we
were in Colombia, there was only money enough to give one child music
lessons. So my brother got the piano lessons. [laughs]
Torre: [00:23:59] Well, did that inspire jealousy? Or did what he was doing inspire
you to want to do the same things? You went to an Ivy League school; he
went to Princeton.

26

Collier: Yes.
Torre: So how did it work for you? Were you jealous of him?
Collier: I don’t remember just jealousy, but I desperately wanted to be a boy. We
were a southern family, and my father was very concerned about manners.
My brother was taught to leap to his feet any time a woman entered the
room kind of thing. So [laughs] I started leaping to my feet whenever a
woman entered the room. And, oh boy, did I get told to sit back down
again. [laughs] Those kinds of experiences taught me that I was a girl.
Torre: How old were you when you were leaping to your feet?
Collier: This was in Belgium.
Torre: So you were elementary school at that time.
Collier: Yes. Elementary school. And I was reading mysteries, so I’d sort of creep
around spying on people and things, again sort of wanting to get out of my
[laughs] humdrum life of being a girl.
Torre: [00:25:11] Were there differences between your father and your mother in
this regard? Your mother, you said, encouraged you to a life of the mind.
Collier: Yes. Yes.
Torre: Which is different than having a career.
Collier: Which is different than having a career, yes.
Torre: But still, was she more concerned about that than your father? Or was that
equal?
Collier: I don’t think so. At that time the only careers open to women were
teaching, nursing, and secretary. Basically that’s what there was. When my
mother had worked for the Foreign Service magazine, she’d been, quote,

27

unquote, “basically a secretary,” although I think she did a major part of the
editing, as well, kind of thing.
[00:26:00] And indeed, when I was in--well, actually, they had both
my brother and me learn typing. But I took shorthand, for example, in my
school. So I was in typing and shorthand.
Torre: When you came to apply to college, which colleges did you apply to? How
did you end up at Radcliffe?
Collier: Well, I was always this sort of little brainiac reader. They asked my brother
about colleges. My brother was the one who suggested Radcliffe. I applied
to Radcliffe, Brown--well, Pembrooke, and [laughs] Swarthmore. I did not
get into Swarthmore. But I got into Pembrooke and Radcliffe. Then he
suggested Radcliffe.
Torre: What was your parents’ attitude to that?
Collier: There was no doubt that I was going to go to college.
Torre: How did you finance college?
Collier: [00:27:00] I had a small scholarship. I think I had it all four years. I think my
parents must have saved. It wasn’t really until late in life that I think my
parents finally got out of debt and then started having more money than
they were spending. Because when they died we had a small inheritance. I
actually honestly don’t know. [laughs]
Torre: Well, there was support there for your college endeavors.
Collier: Yes. Oh, yes. Yes.
Torre: Well, tell me how you came to major in anthropology.

28

Collier: Well, I went to Radcliffe, and I wanted to be an archaeologist. The
department at Harvard was very much into Mayan archaeology, and I really
wanted to be a Mayan archaeologist. Well, I got told fairly fast that women
were stuck in the laboratory. You couldn’t really do anything but be in the
laboratory if you were a woman.
[00:28:10] And also that a woman couldn’t be an archaeologist
because you couldn’t lead a dig because no man would work under you. But
I tried, and indeed, my first summer I got on an archaeology project in
Georgia that was digging one of those mounds that was going to be buried
by the Chattahoochee River. I loved that. I thought that was fun. But it was
pretty clear. [laughs]
Torre: You mentioned to me that in your first semester you took a class that was
very important to you, the “Peoples and Culture of South America.”
Collier: Yes.
Torre: Please tell me about that.
Collier: It was a class that was an upper-level course. It was not an introductory
course. And I had begged to get into it because I had, of course, the
background coming from Quito, Ecuador.
[00:29:03] It was taught by two professors, Gordon Willey, who was a
very famous archaeologist and who did mostly Maya but also in Peru and so
on, and Evon Z. Vogt, who was a cultural anthropologist who taught about
the sort of cultures and the peoples of the cultural side of South America. It
was a full semester course, I think. It was mostly graduate students. And
because I was so afraid of failing the midterm exam, I studied and studied

29

and studied [laughs] and got the best grade in the class on the midterm
exam, which sort of then brought me to the attention of my professors.
I think I remember that as freshman year, but maybe it must have
been sophomore year. I honestly don’t know. Anyway, it brought me to the
attention of Professor Vogt, who then became my mentor professor and
who was very important to my whole career.
Torre: [00:30:11] Tell me something more about him then and your relationship
with him. Was it unusual--well, of course he was teaching at Radcliffe, so he
was teaching women.
Collier: Well, I don’t know if you know about Radcliffe, but Radcliffe was basically
[laughs]--you took all your classes at Harvard.
Torre: I think you did mention that to me. And I’m sorry. Then that changes the
question a little bit. He was very impressed with you and became your
mentor. Was it unusual for him to mentor women students especially?
Collier: I don’t think so. Anthropology has long had sort of important women, like
Margaret Mead and then Cora Du Bois, whose was the one female
professor at Harvard. She was actually the Radcliffe Stone Professor of
Anthropology. [laughs]
[00:31:06] It was a Harvard teaching position. So in that sense there
had been women anthropologists, even though they had usually not been on
the tenure line faculty. Often they had been rich women who had money
and been able to do research and go places. So there was that tradition of
women in anthropology. Again, I didn’t feel any discriminations through

30

college because of being a woman, except for that archaeology--yes, except
in archaeology. [laughs]
Torre: So that’s part of why you were welcomed in anthropology.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: It was similar and-Collier: Cultural. Yes.
Torre: So you proceeded.
Collier: [00:31:52] Yes. In my sophomore year, a new program started up, financed
by I think the Carnegie Foundation, to be able to take undergraduates to do
cultural anthropology field research. And it was for three universities. It was
Cornell, Harvard, and Columbia. Each of them would be able to take six
students to do a summer of fieldwork in--I think it was Ecuador if it was
Columbia. I’ve forgotten where the three of them were. But Professor
Vogt’s work was in Chiapas in southern Mexico.
He was able to recruit six students to go on that. I applied to go, and
because of my [laughs] stellar work in that course I got chosen to be one of
the students to go. George, who was a year behind me but had taken the
seminar--a freshman seminar in anthropology--was also chosen to be one of
the students to go on this summer field project.
Torre: [00:33:09] That worked out perfectly.
Collier: It worked out perfectly. Yes. [laughs]
Torre: So tell me. I would guess that your language skills would have also made you
ideal. But perhaps not if the language you’re--this was not Spanish, anyway.

31

Collier: Well, obviously you needed Spanish as the sort of intermediary language. So
that made well of that, too. Yes. I did have Spanish.
Torre: You mentioned before to me that the visiting Chilean professor, Munro-Collier: Edmondson.
Torre: Edmondson was important to you. Tell me about him.
Collier: That wasn’t until actually much later.
Torre: Okay. Then let’s come back to that.
Collier: Let’s come back to that.
Torre: Excuse me, Jane.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: So actually, I do have down here that I would very much like to know about
the Harvard Chiapas project and its influence on you. What was the focus
of your early research?
Collier: [00:34:02] We were taken down for that sort of first summer. Because they
mixed up students from the three universities, I think we had three from
Harvard. There was one other woman, but she was from Columbia. I think
we had one person from Cornell. There were only two women and four men
[who] went down. Actually, before we went down, at least those of us at
Harvard had a seminar that sort of prepared us and taught us enough of the
[Maya] language so that we would be able to write it down and distinguish
between words and could catch the sounds and write it.
That was very important. So we came down with that kind of
preparation. Because there were just two women, and Professor Vogt didn’t
think we should live out with Indian families--it would be unsafe or I don’t

32

know what. Anyway, he put me together with this woman who was from
Columbia [Peggy Reeves Sanday].
[00:35:06] She was a senior and vastly more sophisticated than I was.
[laughs] We did not hit it off, to put it mildly. He put us out in the town
right on the edge of the city, where the project was sort of headquartered. I
was living in a house with basically a sort of poor Mexican family who called
me Doña Juanita and would do everything for me. It went against my
egalitarian principles. Also, as I say, I didn’t get along with the woman I was
living with.
I’m not sure what affected it, but my professor halfway through the
summer said I could move out to live with an Indian family. This was an
Indian family that sort of owed my professor. He had worked with them,
and they had important ties. [00:36:05] They did not particularly want me.
[laughs] Anyway, he put me out with them.
Torre: Do you mean they would’ve preferred a boy to be there?
Collier: No. I think they would not have preferred anybody to live--the community
of Zinatancan was a very closed and very suspicious community. So the
professor had come in knowing the political leaders. But clearly this political
leader’s family were not thrilled to have somebody that all their neighbors
would gossip about and everything. I was put out to live with this Indian
family. There were about twelve people living in a house about maybe a
third the size of this room. In those days, there were these lovely little
square houses with these huge, high, thatched roofs.

33

[00:36:57] They would live in sort of compounds. This compound
had two or three houses. Anyway, they put me to live in a house where
somebody had died and therefore nobody wanted to live in. [laughs] So I set
my cot up in there. But they would send somebody down to sleep with me
there. So it was a household that had sort of two married couples in it and
one couple that had just been married.
Then I guess--ooh, that’s terrible. I’m forgetting who all was in there.
Anyway, the main household had a whole bunch of people, and I would
spend my time with the women. I guess that first summer what I did was I
tried to take notes on what the women were doing and looking at the sort of
power relationships among women. Because actually, within the household
there was an unmarried daughter who ran the household.
[00:37:56] But the woman who was married to the oldest brother,
even though she had less power within the household, was the person who
would answer when strangers approached or somebody approached. So she
was treated as the head of the females of the household, even though in fact
within the household she had much less power. Anyway, I was sort of
looking at that and what women did. I was 19 years old.
Did I tell you the story of how I was a sort of total failure as a
woman? [laughs] They took me to go get water at the water hole, and you
brought water back in these big jars. Well, I slipped and fell and broke the
water jar. [laughs] Then one of the women’s work was to have sheep that
they would shear and weave the [wool]. We went out to watch the sheep.

34

But I scared the sheep, and they had to spend the whole rest of the day
rounding up the sheep [laughs] that I had scared.
[00:39:02] Then they were trying to teach me to make tortillas. They
would make them [claps] patting them on their hands. I tried, and they
would feed mine to the dogs because they were sort of terrible. I remember
one time sitting just kind of miserably by myself. I could look, and a 45minute-long walk away you could see the Pan-American Highway where it
wound around the mountain. I looked up there and said, “I know how to
drive a car.” [laughs]
I thought how low I had sunk when my one accomplishment in life is
knowing how to drive a car. [laughs] [I later] laughed about how these
people knew why I was nineteen and unmarried because, of course, their
girls got married at sixteen. Anyway, just at the end of the summer I moved
to live with another Indian family who were very welcoming in a different
community, a much more open community than the one I had originally
been in.
[00:40:06] That was really lots of fun. Then I really enjoyed being
with the women. A 13-year-old girl was trying to teach me how to weave
and spent all her time untying the knots I created. Anyway, [laughs] but I
remember that as sort of warm and fun. Those people have remained
friends for the rest of my life.
Torre: I was going to ask what the advantages and disadvantage of being a woman
anthropologist versus a man anthropologist in those--there must be some
advantages.

35

Collier: [laughs] Oh, it was a huge advantage in that the poor men had to drink
because a lot of the culture is--whenever [someone] makes a request of
somebody, they bring liquor. You have to consume the liquor. If you’re a
woman, you didn’t have to drink. But poor George spent a lot of his first
summer down there, which was the summer I was there, either drunk or
trying to throw up all the [laughs] liquor that he had to drink.
Torre: [00:41:06] It doesn’t sound like that attractive of a boyfriend, actually.
Collier: [laughs]
Torre: So were you just friends that summer? Or did you hatch a romantic interest
right away?
Collier: There was a little of both. George, one time he was at another community
about two or two and a half hours’ walk away. He walked over to be with
me or to see me. The other story I tell is because I was living out with this
family that didn’t particularly want me, I’d have to stay for four or five days
at a time and then go back into town and take a bath and things. But I
would take out a little bag of cookies to console myself when I was alone at
night [laughs] and have myself a cookie because all that this family fed me
were beans and tortillas--so a bowl of beans and a bunch of tortillas to go
with it. But they were sometimes cold. Morning, noon, and night. So I had
my little bag of cookies. George walked two hours over the mountains and
came and visited me. I offered him a cookie, and he ate the whole bag.
[laughs] So I never let him forget that one.
Torre: Well, you let him eat the whole bag.
Collier: [laughs]

36

Torre: So that was the first summer.
Collier: That was the first summer.
Torre: But you went back to Chiapas repeatedly.
Collier: Yes. Repeatedly. That was the summer of 1960. The nice thing about
Professor Vogt was that he required you to write a paper on what you’d
done. So that was the summer that I wrote the paper on women’s division
of labor within this household.
[00:42:58] Then the second summer of 1961, that was when I started
a project to interview about courtship customs. That was [after] my junior
year. That interviewing on courtship customs became my senior honors
thesis.
Torre: I have noticed from your publications that you fairly quickly developed an
interest in law. I’m not going to say it correctly. Zinacantan law?
Collier: Yes.
Torre: Did that only come after you had graduated? Or did that interest start
during these summers?
Collier: It came basically after I graduated. [Before] I did the courtship study that
became my senior honors thesis--I talk about sort of Professor Vogt being
my mentor and all. He was the one who praised my honors thesis and made
it so that I graduated from Radcliffe with a summa.
Torre: [00:44:15] So what were his expectations for you? What did he want you to
go do?
Collier: [laughs] He was wonderful in that sense. He encouraged people to do their
own projects. He wasn’t one of these professors who wanted you to work

37

on what he wanted to work on. He was very interested in religion and then
later on into astronomy, Maya astronomy and stuff. He let other people do
what interested them. He was really quite wonderful that way. He really
helped you.
All during the summers, too, he would have gatherings where we
would share our research. I got into doing collaborative research very early
on. [00:45:00] We learned in that project--we’d make three copies of our
field notes. One of them was for us. One of them was to give to him. And
one of them was to mail home to our parents so that if anything happened
there would be a copy back home, and also our parents would get
something from us. [laughs] That sort of thing of making three copies of
field notes was something I did the rest of my life. Then we also shared the
field notes with each other and talked about it. There were a bunch of us-he always had a graduate student down there, as well. The people who were
graduate students in our early years have remained dear friends through life.
Torre: What I meant, though, was here you were in college from 1958 to 1962.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: Did he expect you to go get a PhD? Was he encouraging you to look at
graduate programs?
Collier: [00:45:59] Yes. I think there was always a sense that I would go on to
graduate study. They did have women in the graduate program in
Anthropology and Social Relations. Yes.
Torre: What were the expectations generally at Radcliffe amongst your classmates
as to their future lives?

38

Collier: Oh, you were groomed up to be good hostesses and then [laughs] good
wives to important men.
Torre: Was that the message you also got from other professors and
administrators? Or was it just so well understood?
Collier: I guess it was just well understood. That was the 1950s.
Torre: Okay. So you graduated from college. You marry George in 1962.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: [00:46:59] You had two children by 1965.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: Which is well before the women’s movement blossomed.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: So at the time you were getting married and having small children, I would
like to know what your expectations were for marriage, motherhood, and
work. How were you thinking about it then? 1962 to 1965.
Collier: Well, George and I got married in 1962. Actually, our wedding was the day
before the Radcliffe graduation. One of the things I always thought was
terribly unfair was that because I was, quote, unquote, “married” on the day
which I graduated, my diploma reads Collier as my last name. And I thought
that was terribly unfair to my poor father, who’d had to pay for the
education. [laughs] But that’s what you did back then. So George and I went
off that summer to Mexico.
[00:48:00] Because he was a year behind me, he still had courses [to
finish]. That summer in Mexico, Professor Vogt started using George as his
person to run field programs. George probably had responsibilities and stuff

39

like that. Anyway, we were down there. This was our third summer down
there. Because Chiapas had lots of Indian groups, there was a whole group
from the University of Chicago that had a bunch of graduate students down
there that we all knew.
At the end of the summer as people were leaving there was a woman
who had been an ex-pat who’d been very involved with anthropologists
who died. Her name was Bobbie Montague. [00:49:01] What had happened
was a very famous Maya archaeologist was coming to visit. Because George
and--Professor Vogt was not there--George and I were living in the main
house. So George and I invited him and a bunch of other people to have
cocktails. So we had the sort of cocktails. Then other people left or
something, and we had this guy on to dinner.
I’ve forgotten exactly how, but anyway, this woman, Bobbie Montague,
who was living very close by the Harvard Ranch--because Harvard had rented
a whole, big ranch--she went home and collapsed and died right away. So she
had died, and she just had cocktails at our place. [00:50:00] A Mexican friend
later told us that if they hadn’t done an autopsy and found that she’d died of a
massive heart attack, we would’ve been in jail because they would’ve assumed
we had poisoned her.
Anyway, most of the other anthropologists who were down there for
the summer had left or were about to leave. George and I felt we couldn’t
leave because, actually, Bobbie Montague died in the house of a guy who
was a graduate student from Chicago.

40

So we felt we had to stand by them and stay down. We stayed down
through the sort of arrangements to ship Bobbie Montague’s body back and
so on. That meant we had to get back to the States really fast. So [laughs] we
had this incredible sort of fast drive up through Mexico. We went to
George’s parents in New Mexico.
[00:51:00] But that’s why we had an accidental baby the following
year, [laughs] we were under all this incredible stress. Anyway, we did get
back to Harvard, and George did his half-year undergraduate work. By that
time I was pregnant. So in December we went-Torre: So you were not working at that point?
Collier: No. I wasn’t working at that point. I may have been working as a research
assistant, I think. Both George and I did a lot of research assistant work. In
fact, when we got married, both of us had an economic cushion because we
had-Torre: All of this work in Chiapas and the research assistants were paid. They were
not unpaid internships.
Collier: No. The Chiapas work basically paid your expenses. But we did sort of
research work when we were at Harvard, so that money all went into the
pot, as it were.
[00:52:03] I probably continued that kind of research assistant stuff
for people. Actually, just to go back, when I was interested in archaeology in
my early time at Radcliffe, again, I both had a little scholarship and I also
did work. I was working at Peabody Museum repairing pots, archaeological

41

pots. This was wonderful, like a puzzle. Because you have to put these pot
pieces back together. I loved that job. That was really fun.
All the way through I had these kind of jobs that brought in a little
bit of money and helped pay for college and things. Anyway, back to
December of 1962. George finished up his coursework, and we went back
to Chiapas for the spring and that summer. And we had applied for
Fulbright fellowships, both of us.
[00:53:08] We got the Fulbright fellowships, so that meant we were
going to Spain in the fall of 1963.
Torre: Now, you had separate Fulbrights, is that right?
Collier: Yes. We had separate Fulbrights. Yes.
Torre: So was your research in Spain on different issues? In the same place but not
the same research? Not the same topic.
Collier: I’ve forgotten how we wrote it up. It was basically to do a comparison
between the small community in Mexico, mountain, 300 people,
agricultural--and a small mountain community of 300 agricultural people in
Spain. I’ve forgotten. I don’t remember exactly how we wrote it up. I don’t
remember what you had to do for a Fulbright then because it may just have
been to kind of study and stuff.
[00:54:00] We were associated with the University of Sevilla. We both
had those fellowships and went to Spain. Maybe if I could stop for a little bit?
Torre: Yes.
[break]

42

Collier: [laughs] Okay. Let me tell you about having a baby in Mexico. Because as I
said, George and I went down. Through the spring and summer of 1963 we
were in Mexico. Of course, I was pregnant in the spring. The baby was born
in June. I actually went to Mexico City to have the baby because there were
no incubators south of Mexico City. George’s older brother and his wife
had had a child in Oaxaca who died because there was no care.
So I went to Mexico City and [laughs] lived with a Foreign Service
friend of my parents in Mexico City and went and had the baby at the, I
guess, Mexican-American hospital in Mexico City. George came up when
the baby was actually born. Then we went back down to Chiapas.
[00:55:01] My parents at this time were again in the Foreign Service.
After Ecuador my father did some more time in Washington. Then he went
to the embassy in Lima, Peru. In case I don’t mention it, [my parents] ended
up in Spain at the end of the time George and I were there. So my parents
were not at my wedding because they were in Peru and of course didn’t
have the money to return for my wedding and didn’t see the baby until he
was about nine or ten months old.
I carried the baby back to Chiapas. And Professor Vogt’s wife, Nan
Vogt, who was always a very important part of all of the research in Chiapas
because she kept us all together and was a very important part of giving the
group spirit--Nan Vogt was the one who taught me how to take care of a
baby.

43

Torre: [00:56:02] I am curious if your status went up in Chiapas now that you had a
child. As a woman with a child, did you have access to different information
than before?
Collier: Not that I recall, actually. I don’t remember what I was researching that
summer, if I was. I do have [laughs] a memory of being seven months
pregnant and sort of very large. We were out at a festival in the Indian
community. It was dry season. There was dust. Poor George had to drink as
I mentioned--and drank and drank and drank.
So he sort of says, “I’m tired. I want to go to sleep.” So he lay down
beside me on the dirt. I, like a good Indian woman, sat kneeling beside him
watching over my husband. A whole bunch of women came up to me and
would say, “He’s drunk, isn’t he?” [laughs] I’d say, “Yes, he’s drunk.”
[00:57:00] Then they’d say, “Does he beat you?” [laughs] It took me a
long time to realize that there wasn’t, in fact, actually a lot of wife beating.
Because it was a system where Indian women had to go live with their
husbands’ families when they married, the only reason you could give to go
running home to your own parents was that you had been beaten. While
there was, in fact, real wife beating, there was also--this was a woman’s one
excuse to be able to go back and stay with her family and have her family
sort of sanction her husband to get him to shape up and so on. So it was
this complicated thing. Sort of the women sharing of, “Did he beat you?”
Going on to Spain, George and I, with a three-month-old baby, took
off for Spain.

44

Torre: How did you balance having a small child and doing research? How did you
and George handle all that in Spain?
Collier: [00:58:00] Well, George is a wonderful father. He always did a lot of the
childcare. Also, little tiny babies--he was basically breastfeeding, didn’t eat
anything except that. We arrived in Spain, and we [lived] in this little village
and got a woman to work for us to help take care of the baby. She was
wonderful. Then it turns out that Spaniards love babies. [laughs]
As soon as the little girls got out of school at 4:00--at what? 2:00 in
the afternoon, some little girl would come by and pick up the baby. And I
wouldn’t see him again until I had to change him or he wanted food. Having
a baby in Spain was very, very easy in that kind of thing.
Torre: Tell me again about Professor Munro Edmondson. Because you--when did
you first meet him?
Torre: [00:59:00] Well, it was probably still a while later because after the year in
Spain, in the summer of 1964, we came back and went back to Chiapas.
Then George went into graduate school. George was in graduate school for
two years doing his coursework in the Department of Social Relations at
Harvard. I had wanted to go to graduate school, but they changed it so that
you could not go part-time. I had a baby. Actually, that was a real
disappointment.
Because our president was Mary Bunting at Radcliffe. She was a
career woman and always interested in women having careers. Yet it was
under her that this policy got started that made it impossible for women
with children [to attend graduate school]. There was also, of course, as you

45

probably know, at that time a lot of stuff about, “Oh, if a woman has
children, she’s not going to go on to have a job and do anything.”
[01:00:00] I was out of the work force for two years that George was
doing his coursework. I got pregnant again that summer, I guess. Because
Lucy was born in 1965.
Torre: So that’s 1964 to 1966.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: You were just living in Cambridge.
Collier: Cambridge. Yes. Well, the first year with a one-year-old and pregnant and
sort of oblivious. The second year [laughs] we had a two-year-old and a
baby and I was going nuts. [laughs] Then you asked me about Munro
Edmondson. Yes. That was the time I decided I really had to go back to
graduate school. Munro Edmondson was there at Harvard that year, and I
got to know him. He’s a Maya scholar. That’s what made it--well, two
things. Living in Boston with two little kids who had to get in and out of
snowsuits was getting really hard.
[01:01:01] Then it looked like Tulane was a wonderful place to do
Mesoamerica and Maya work. I applied to Tulane.
Torre: Was it chance that you met him? Or did you do research work for him? Or
did you hunt him out in desperation?
Collier: No, no, no. George got to know him. So it became clear that Tulane was a
place possible to go.

46

Torre: That actually is a question that I had, which is how did you and George
support each other’s careers--it sounds like you deferred your needs while
he did coursework.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: He looked out for you-Collier: Yes.
Torre: Tell me more about how you supported each other in this mutual work?
Collier: Well, the two years that he was doing graduate work at Harvard, as I said,
the first year I was kind of oblivious with pregnancy hormones. And the
second year was going nuts. Actually, both years I did research work for
professors. So I always did something to earn a little bit of money, but
basically I stayed home those years and took care of the kids.
[01:02:08] Then when George finished his two years and I got into
graduate school at Tulane, we moved to New Orleans [after spending a year
in Chiapas]. We had a two-year-old and a four-year-old. George was writing
his dissertation, so he basically stayed home and took care of--the kids were
in nursery school and stuff. But he did a lot of the childcare that year and
actually the two years that I--his first year in New Orleans he was writing his
dissertation. Then the second year he had a fellowship too, a post-doc.
So he did a lot of the childcare during the two years that I did
coursework at Tulane.
Torre: Tell me. When did you first become aware of the women’s movement? And
do you remember any feminist works or feminist leaders that you read in
the mid-1960s?

47

Collier: No. [laughs]
Torre: [01:03:09] So when did you first become aware of the women’s movement?
Collier: I don’t think it was till that 1971 when we were all those graduate students
and wives at Stanford.
Torre: Okay. Hold that for a minute.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: But it was later then?
Collier: It was later then. Yes.
Torre: So just hold that thought for a minute until we get to Stanford. Did you
research in Spain and Chiapas regarding women and their roles in the
society, did that affect your thinking about male and female social roles in
the US at that time?
Collier: Not that I remember. Yes. No. [laughs]
Torre: Okay. I think that’s important.
Collier: [01:03:58] Yes. Then I guess what I should say is actually between George
finishing his two years of coursework at Harvard and before we moved to New
Orleans, we spent a full year in Mexico doing research. He was doing the
research for his dissertation. Actually, that’s when I did the research for my
dissertation. I think it must’ve been during the year before that when George
was in his second year of graduate study at Harvard that with Professor Vogt I
worked out what I was going to do my dissertation research on.
That’s when I got interested in law. Because so many areas of
Zinacanteco culture had been covered by other people--[because of] so
many researchers down there--he sort of mentioned that “I think law was

48

one of the things that nobody had [yet] done.” I think it must have been
that year, it was the second year of George’s graduate work--when I had a
one-year-old and a three-year-old that I did basically the library research, the
background for my dissertation, what was done in the anthropology of law.
[01:05:13] I had a lot of help because Professor Laura Nader at
Berkeley had been a graduate student at Harvard. Her area was law. So even
though she had moved to Berkeley, she sent me reading lists and things like
that. She was a very big help to me in preparing to then go to Chiapas to do
work on law. After George’s two years of coursework and my two years of
staying home with babies, [laughs] we moved to Chiapas for a year and
again had servants and so on. So I was really able to do heavy research.
That’s when I did the research for my dissertation.
Torre: [01:05:58] You mentioned library research and background reading.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: But you were also doing field research in law. Were you not?
Collier: That was afterwards when we got to Chiapas.
Torre: So were you accepted as a woman inquiring on that topic, which perhaps
men were involved with rather than women?
Collier: Oh, totally men were involved with. [laughs]
Torre: So I’m asking was that easy for you to be invited into men’s councils and
observe conflicts being resolved? How did that go?
Collier: No. Because the Harvard project had been well ensconced down there, and
Harvard had developed a system of paying men for what they would have
made in a day wage if they came and were interviewed by us. There is a

49

whole controversy in anthropology over whether you should pay people or
not. But Harvard did develop this thing [where] if they were going to spend
a day answering our questions, we paid them what they would have made.
Torre: [01:07:04] You didn’t pay them more. You just defrayed their opportunity
cost.
Collier: Yes. [laughs] [I think we paid them a little bit more. We were always also
soft touches for loans]. [laughs] There was a whole tradition of and a group
of men who’d been political leaders and stuff--because that’s who Professor
Vogt had worked with and so on--who were willing to be interviewed. So
most of my research was based on interviews with people who had--the
presidente of the community was the guy who settled cases. So I got to
interview three or four past presidentes about cases.
That was the major part of the research. I did go out and try and sit
in the court a few times. It was fairly uncomfortable in the sense that it was
a masculine world. Most of my research was done on this interviewing basis.
Torre: [01:08:01] Then of course by that time you had returned to that community
for five years.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: And had a status that was quite different than your first summer.
Collier: Yes. Oh, yes. No. I was no longer the [laughs]-Torre: Okay. So I think that now we’re ready to come to Stanford.
Collier: Stanford. Okay.
Torre: Is that right?
Collier: That’s right. Yes.

50

Torre: Good? Okay. So first, just tell me how you and George happened to come
to Stanford. How did George get hired here?
Collier: The “old boy” network. Those were still the days when if an assistant
professor was needed at Stanford, the department wrote to Harvard to Yale
and so on and said, “Who do you have who would fill this role?” I think
George had about two or three offers, but it came in through the old boy
network. He decided on Stanford.
Torre: Was that a family decision or related simply to the opportunity?
Collier: [01:09:00] I didn’t have any basis for making any decisions. It was really
what he wanted to do. Yes.
Torre: At that time what was your expectation and what was George’s expectation
about your future work or research?
Collier: It’s hard to say. There was always the sense that I would have a career in
anthropology as a researcher and so on. Indeed, I was very successful at
getting fellowships. I went through graduate school on a National Science
Foundation fellowship. Then later when I came to Stanford I had a National
Institutes of Mental Health post-doctoral fellowship.
So actually both George and I got through graduate school and
everything on government fellowships, which were generous and supported
us for those years. When both of us had a fellowship, we could live fairly
reasonably. [laughs]
Torre: [01:10:05] Well, was your expectation that you would be able to do research
and publish and get fellowships but were unlikely to get an appointment?

51

Did you even think about it or talk about it in the busy life you were
leading?
Collier: Again, I have no recollection of thinking about whether it would be possible
to be a professor. Tulane actually did have women professors. But again, I
sort of went with the flow. I was still working on my degree kind of thing.
Torre: This is a question that’s just popping into my mind now. Given that it was
so hard for married women to be appointed.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: [01:10:58] There were a few spinsters who had careers in academics but few
of them.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: I’m wondering whether the field of anthropology was more welcoming in
part because men who wished to do anthropology on family institutions
really did not have access to the women’s world unless they had a wife or a
female researcher.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: Do you think that at all affected the openness of anthropology departments
to women students?
Collier: Again, I don’t know. I sound terrible, but I wasn’t thinking about these
things [laughs] back then. I had the support of Professor Vogt. I had a good
life. I had things that I was interested in, and I did them. I don’t know that I
thought about the future so much. [laughs]
Torre: Jane, I can’t imagine how with two children under four and a thesis to write
and probably some meals to cook somewhere in there --

52

Collier: [01:12:04] Yes. No, I was the cook those years.
Torre: How you had five minutes to think about anything not immediately
necessary.
Collier: Oh. [laughs]
Torre: [laughs]
Collier: Well, as I said, at Tulane , George took care of the children a lot. Then
when we moved to Stanford, that first year I wrote my dissertation. But the
little one was four years old, and she was in nursery school virtually all day.
The older one was in the Palo Alto schools. He would get out at 2:00, so I’d
pick him up at 2:00. Actually, we’d go up to the park above Palo Alto
because we were living in Palo Alto. We’d walk--David and I would walk for
a couple of hours. And then we’d come back and pick up Lucy and bring
her home. I had basically all morning to write.
Torre: Sounds like a good life.
Collier: [laughs]
Torre: [01:13:00] So tell me about the composition of Stanford’s Anthropology
Department at that time when you arrived in 1969. And what were the
prominent fields of research?
Collier: Oh. Oh, dear.
Torre: Well, I understand that there was a lot of linguistic anthropology at the time.
Collier: Well, Joe Greenberg was there. And Joe Greenberg was a very famous
linguist, yes.
Torre: And mathematical anthropology.
Collier: Oh, that’s true. Okay. [laughs]

53

Torre: But I’m thinking also of the people that seemed prominent or the
composition in terms of women or men. Anything that comes to mind.
Collier: Oh. Well, obviously it was all men. George Spindler was there and his wife,
Louise, who was very important, was the lecturer--and they would teach
together. But Louise was just a--quote, “just a lecturer.”
[01:13:59] There was another woman called Peggy Golde who was in
another department. I’ve forgotten what department she was in. But she was
on the professor line. And she had a part-time appointment. Again, the vision
was that women could only be part-time. She wasn’t a real member of the
Anthropology Department.
Torre: They could only be part-time because they had spouses who were in the
department or--?
Collier: Oh, no, no, no. I don’t even think she was married. I think she was in
another department and therefore had a courtesy appointment, one of those
kinds of things.
Torre: Oh, you mean she was in a different department and had taught one class in
anthropology?
Collier: Yes. That kind of thing. Yes.
Torre: So part-time in two departments.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: And not tenure track in either? Or?
Collier: I honestly don’t know. I think she was maybe tenure track. But again, I’m
not certain. But there were no women on the tenure line faculty in
Anthropology itself. Yes.

54

Torre: [01:14:59]I understand that Louise Spindler really co-researched and copublished with her husband but was appointed year after year after year as a
lecturer.
Collier: Yes. Lecturer. [laughs]
Torre: Is that correct?
Collier: I think that’s correct. Yes.
Torre: [laughs] Yes. And in a very short time, there were three couples--you and
the Rosaldos and the Spindlers--that all taught in Anthropology. That was
new. Can you explain when you started teaching at Stanford and what your
official role was in the beginning?
Collier: Well, the first year I was at Stanford, like I said, I wrote my dissertation. I
applied for a post-doctoral fellowship to do work on law--anthropology and
law. The next two years I had a two-year post-doctoral fellowship.
Torre: [01:16:01] This is 1970 to 1972.
Collier: Yes. In that year of 1971, I guess, 1970-1971 I taught, I think, an
undergraduate seminar on anthropology of law or something like that as a
post-doctoral fellow. That year of 1971-1972 I may have done that kind of
teaching. That was the year--because there were women graduate students in
anthropology--and that was the year when Shelly and Renato (Rosaldo) first
came to Stanford, as well. Renato also got hired through the “old boy”
network and came to Stanford, bringing Shelly with him. Shelly was writing
her dissertation for Harvard then. That was the year when there was Shelly
and I as sort of faculty spouses who had background in anthropology.

55

[01:16:59] You should know we knew Shelly and Renato because they
were part of the Harvard Chiapas project for a period. But there were also
four women graduate students [at Stanford]. It was really through Shelly.
Shelly came to Stanford having participated in the sort of feminist
movement in Massachusetts in “bread and roses” or whatever that sort of-anyway, they had consciousness raising groups and things like that. She had
been part of that, and she brought that with her to Stanford.
She must’ve been a major part of then organizing that sort of
collective where the four woman graduate students and Shelly and I would
meet and decided to develop a course on women in cross-cultural
perspective, to look at what in fact the anthropological record had to say
about what women were doing.
Torre: So that group was a group of women, but it was not a consciousness-raising
group. It was focused on-Collier: [01:18:00] Focused on reading ethnographies and trying to figure out what
women were in fact doing.
Torre: Did it start out with that focus? Or did it just emerge out of your getting
together as the women in the department?
Collier: Oh, it started with that focus. Yes. Because anthropology at the time was
very much of the idea that because women were so preoccupied with raising
children [laughs] and taking care of houses, cooking, and the laundry and
things that they didn’t have time to--they left the economy and the polity to
men. Anthropologists had studied the economics and the politics and the
religion. So basically this was a group of women who decided to get

56

together and say, “Hey, wait a minute. What in fact have women been doing
around the world?” [laughs]
Torre: But all of you were in Anthropology.
Collier: All of us were in Anthropology.
Torre: You were all cultural anthropologists.
Collier: There’s only cultural anthropology [at Stanford] except for Joe Greenberg as
a linguist. And I think they had a couple of archaeologists.
Torre: [01:19:04] So what I think Michelle Rosaldo referred to as the Stanford women’s
teaching collective in 1970 to 1971, that was at the time just anthropologists
developing the course that you then went on to co-teach with Shelly.
Collier: Yes. Well, we all taught it, I think, that first year. I think the whole collective
got together and taught a course. It must’ve been maybe in spring quarter of
1971 or something.
Torre: It was an undergraduate course?
Collier: It was an undergraduate course. Yes.
Torre: So what kind of students did you have? Were they all women? Were they
across the board?
Collier: I think they must’ve been all women. I’ve truly, totally forgotten. [laughs]
Torre: It’s only forty-five years ago. You can be forgiven, Jane, for forgetting.
Collier: No.
Torre: You were teaching your post-doc fellowship course related to your field of
anthropology of law.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: [01:20:04] Then you with others were teaching this course.

57

Collier: Yes.
Torre: How were you being paid? As a lecturer? Or was Stanford just happy to
accept your free work? Or?
Collier: I think so. Again, I don’t remember. I was on a post-doc, so I don’t think I
could have other kinds of money.
Torre: Was Shelly also on a post-doc at that point? You said had been writing her
dissertation.
Collier: She was writing her dissertation. Yes. I think she was probably on a
National Science Foundation fellowship, which was how I wrote my
dissertation when I first came. Yes.
Torre: So initially you actually didn’t even have an official role with Stanford as
opposed to with a post-doc.
Collier: No.
Torre: Tell me about Benjamin Paul’s influence on the direction of the department
and opportunities for women.
Collier: Well, he’s obviously the reason that Shelly and I got hired. He was a cultural
anthropologist who’d done work in Guatemala and has chaired the department
and was always very interested in sort of building up the department.
[01:21:15] Basically he has a wonderful wife, Lois Paul, who is an
artist, but as you were talking about, wives of anthropologists did a lot of
[laughs] the sort of field work, too. So she had done work on midwives and
so on in Guatemala. Actually, she has an article in that [Woman, Culture and
Society] book on midwives. Well, money for affirmative action came along,
and Anthropology was given money for one FTE [full time equivalent], one

58

full-time appointment. Ben Paul took the money and divided it between
Shelly and me.
[01:22:03] Actually, it was sort of between the couples. We were each
offered a half-time appointment. And Renato and Shelly, because Renato
had just started teaching, too, and they had no children, decided they would
split it three-quarters and three-quarters. So the time and a half, Renato’s
position, and Shelly’s half. And split it three-quarters, three-quarters.
George, because he’d already been teaching for two years and had the salary
increments that came with that, he kept [his FTE]. I stayed half time. So we
divided it. He kept a full-time, and I had a half-time appointment.
Torre: Was the teaching load half time truly?
Collier: Oh, yes. The teaching load was half time. Actually, again, I’m less certain
how it all had worked out. Ben Paul arranged for me to teach one of the
courses in the Law School. I guess the other one must’ve been in
Anthropology.
[01:23:04] I taught for three years in the Law School. It was not a
very good experience for me and I don’t think for most of my students. The
first year that I taught an anthropology of law course I had about thirty
students or something like that. I was young and didn’t know much about
teaching. I didn’t do the work of trying to figure out what on earth they
really wanted. I taught about what anthropologists were interested in in
anthropology of law, which had a lot to do with debates about how you
understood law in other societies and what was law and all of this kind of
stuff. And was there something called “law” that every society had? And all

59

of these kinds of anthropological debates. When I was near the end of the
course, a young man stood up in the class and said, “You have taught me
nothing I cared to learn.” [laughs] So that was sort of pretty, pretty horrible.
I was devastated.
[01:24:02] I talked with Barbara Babcock, who was teaching in the Law
School and sort of said, “What can I do?” She said, “The law students are
used to being told authoritarian. You’re supposed to--the professor knows
what the answer is, and you use the Socratic method and pull it out of them.
But you know what the answer is.” I kept saying, “But the whole thing about
anthropology is it’s all about questions and [laughs] not about answers.”
My career as an authoritarian law teacher was nonexistent. Then the
third year I was teaching in the Law School I had about maybe ten students
in a seminar. And these were people who were really, genuinely interested in
what other societies looked like. So actually that year I had a wonderful
course and a great time. But because I was teaching so few students, the law
school decided that I was not worth it. They were probably right. I did all
my teaching in Anthropology after that.
Torre: I note that in 1972 that was the first time that there was a female professor
hired in the Law School.
Collier: Oh, really? Which was Barbara Babcock.
Torre: I don’t know whether she was hired there or like you seconded from
somewhere else. But the chronology states that the first Law School
professor that was a woman was in 1972.
Collier: Yes.

60

Torre: That does explain some things, anyway. If you know, I would like to know
whether the funding for that full-time equivalent that was split between the
Rosaldos and the Colliers, was that Stanford money? Or was that money
that they received from some other source as part of affirmative action?
Were they going out of their general fund to give those funds to
Anthropology?
Collier: [01:26:09] I think so. Al Hastorf was wonderful about trying to encourage
affirmative action.
Torre: Was he a dean?
Collier: He was a dean, yes.
Torre: A dean of the social sciences? [Editor: Albert Hastorf was dean of the
School of Humanities & Sciences from 1970 to 1973]
Collier: I think so, yes.
Torre: Okay. So how was the rest of the Anthropology Department, how did they
look upon this action by Benjamin Paul? Was it just taken for granted as a
natural thing or--?
Collier: As far as I know, people were very nice to us.
Torre: It wasn’t offered to Louise Spindler.
Collier: [laughs] No.
Torre: [laughs] Do you think the Spindlers indicated they didn’t need this after so
many years?
Collier: [01:27:02] I honestly don’t know. George Spindler’s main appointment was
in the School of Education. Yes.

61

Torre: Okay. I have read that there had at the end of the 1960s been a sort of
perhaps informal nepotism rule that one could not have a spouse teaching
in the same department. Do you remember whether that was set aside or
discussed?
Collier: It was discussed. Again, George would be better at all of this than me.
When they investigated, they found that there was not in fact a rule. [laughs]
They did investigate, yes, because people thought there was a nepotism rule.
When they went to look for it, it didn’t exist.
Torre: So this informal understanding that had been used to stop certain things in
fact didn’t exist.
Collier: [01:28:01] Yes. Yes.
Torre: Lastly here, you mentioned to me once before that there was federal
funding in foundation support from you mentioned the National Institute
of Mental Health and that there was language support for area studies. I
would just like to know about the funding that became available nationally
and what its goal was and how it affected opportunities in the social sciences
and anthropology at that time in the late 1960s. To the extent you can tell
me.
Collier: I don’t know for sure. But certainly our experience was that there was money
available. They were funding the social sciences. The National Institutes of
Mental Health was, again, interested in cultural differences as that obviously
affects people’s mental health, what they’re doing.
[01:29:01] As I say, my experience was that there was money for the
social sciences.

62

Torre: How nice. [laughs]
Collier: How nice. I know. It all went away. Yes.
Torre: So now let me ask you a few things about Stanford at that time. Just to
mention for the record, there was tremendous political turmoil going on at
Stanford when you arrived. In 1969 there were anti-war demonstrations.
There were counter demonstrations. Protestors disrupted trustee meetings.
Buildings were occupied.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: There was protest against the classified research that was being funded,
ROTC, SRI. You were very busy at that time, but did any of this affect your
life? Were you involved with students who had concerns?
Collier: [01:29:58] Not that I remember. I was busy leading my own life.
Torre: Of course, in 1970 there was the bombing of Cambodia and a great deal of
uproar about that. Associate professor Bruce Franklin encouraged students to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war. Then following the takeover
of the Computation Center, he was suspended and later fired in 1973. Were
people in the Anthropology Department concerned about what had happened
to him? Concerned about what was happening on campus? Do you remember
any debates?
Collier: I don’t. I know George got sort of interested, because at one point people
were saying, “Is Stanford enforcing all of these ridiculous laws like you’re
not allowed to cut the flowers?” And lots of things. [laughs]
[01:31:05] I remember some of that kind of talk. That was when the
academic freedom committee got started to try and think about how would

63

you define academic freedom. What is academic freedom? Obviously there’s
an enormous difference between trashing the computer center and doing
research that might be unpopular or something. So trying to draw the lines a
bit. George participated in the committee on that.
That was, as a wife, again, peripheral to--that was what I knew about
it. It took me a long time to turn against the Vietnam War. I was a child of
government. So I kept thinking the government was doing the right thing
until it became very clear that the government was [laughs] not doing the
right thing. Again, I was very much on the peripheries.
Torre: [01:32:07] Okay. I want to go back, then, to what happened in the beginning
of the 1970s with the teaching collective and going on from there to talk
about CROW and feminist studies and your involvement with anything. So
I have a set of questions on these issues. First to start again, in 1970 and
1971 it’s really specifically the Anthropology Department.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: You told me that this all culminated in the course that a lot of people were
involved in and supporting. I believe you went on to teach this class with
Shelly Rosaldo for many years after that.
Collier: Yes. Virtually every year. Yes.
Torre: “Women in Cross Cultural Perspective.”
Collier: Yes.
Torre: [01:33:02] Were there other things that grew out of that collective other than
that course?

64

Collier: Obviously, the book, Woman, Culture, and Society. There was the whole
putting together of the book that I was again somewhat peripherally
involved in because Shelly and Louise Lamphere were the two editors. I
wrote an article and participated.
Torre: Forgive me. But was Louise Lamphere here at Stanford?
Collier: No. She was again somebody who’d been at Harvard with Shelly. She taught
in New Mexico, I think. Basically her career’s been in New Mexico.
Torre: Okay.
Collier: [01:33:58] It was a national movement in anthropology among feminist
anthropologists. Shelly brought a lot of contacts with her from her years at
Harvard because I had been away from Harvard for a long time. But she
was part of that whole Massachusetts group. Then there were a bunch of
them out here with Berkeley, as well. It became this bicoastal thing of
feminist scholars who would get together--well, the feminist anthropologists
who would get together.
Torre: You just used the term feminist anthropologist. And it was the first time
you’ve used that phrasing. I’m wondering when this group of
anthropologists first started thinking of themselves that way. Was that right
in 1970, 1971? Or did that take time?
Collier: Certainly was for me. It was certainly for me. Presumably Shelly, because of
the group in Massachusetts, had been part of it before--of feminist scholars.
Torre: Myra Strober says that you and Shelly Rosaldo changed the field of
anthropology.
Collier: [01:35:02] [laughs] Oh, that’s very kind of her.

65

Torre: That was her statement. I would love to hear you talk more on how your
approach to the study of gender roles and kinship theory was different from
previous anthropological work.
Collier: Previous anthropological work had assumed that men did politics,
economics, and religion basically, and that women stayed home and took
care of the children. So just sort of having an anthropology that said, “No,
women were doing all kinds of things,” and then trying to look at how even
women, quote, unquote, “being at home” had a whole lot of effect on what
kind of power men could achieve and so on.
[01:35:54]A lot of anthropology, because it was supposed to focus on
non-Western, quote, unquote, “primitive” societies and in societies that
don’t have state governments, the political anthropology of the day saw
politics as being based on kinship systems. But obviously if you’re going to
have a polity based on kinship systems, that means that women have to be
in there, even though a lot of it was done as lineages of men kind of thing.
Even matrilineal societies were seen as a man to his sister’s son kind of
thing.
So once you start putting the sisters back in and saying, “Hey, wait a
minute. What do sisters have to think about this?” Or in patrilineal societies
like in Chiapas where I was, “What are women’s roles in this?” All of a
sudden what you realize is that women played an enormously important
role.
[01:36:54] Just to, again, give an example, in Zinacantan, at that point
in history, there was a lot of land available. What determined how much

66

corn a man could produce had to do with how many men he could get
working for and contributing to his granary. So it was really control of the
labor that you wanted. They had a whole system of marriage with
bridewealth where a young man, in order to get married, had to give these
lavish gifts of food and liquor and so on to the bride’s family over a twoyear period.
A young man had no way to get this [laughs] unless his elders helped
him. So the young couples would marry and be terribly in debt and have to
live with the man’s family and work for them. Usually they worked for the
husband’s family until they had two or three children who ate more than the
parents could produce.
[01:38:01] But because men became really important by helping
various young men marry and building up a big labor force that would
enable you to farm more land, to have more corn, to be able to put on more
ceremonies and so on--what was women’s role in this?
I had done my work on courtship and marriage. I talked about wife
beating as being the way a woman justified being able to run home to her
parents. When you really started to look at what women did and what
women’s interests were, often women’s interests were to get out from under
the mother-in-law and all of this. [laughs] So you’d get women running
home to their parents. Also, it was in the interests of her father to keep her
and keep her husband there. So women were crucial to older men’s ability to
build up these big households.

67

[01:38:59] All of a sudden that’s, in a sense, what a lot of us brought
to anthropology--looking at women as much more kind of actors in the
world, who had interests and were doing things that affected outcomes,
even if you, quote, unquote, saw them as “staying home with the children.”
Although, again, we looked at lots of places where women basically ran the
economy and the markets. They were the farmers and et cetera, et cetera.
In that sense, I think my generation brought a lot of change to
anthropology. It was the sense--although, again, it’s really hard to change a
field to looking at women and men as both actors in the world, rather than
just men as actors and women as staying and taking care of the children.
Torre: [01:39:59] What I’m hearing here, partly, is simply that previous
anthropologists, largely men, had brought their own prejudices to the
situation.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: And that as more women entered the field, they simply looked at what was
actually happening and spent more time documenting that. How were your
theories treated in the department at Stanford?
Collier: I remember just the thing about our department at Stanford was sort of it
was Shelly and me. George and Renato were obviously on our side. Then
people like Don Donham came, who was interested in Marxism, and
Bridget O’Laughlin, who was interested in Marxism. Because the other thing
that came in was questions about gender equality and inequality.
[01:41:00] Maybe one of the important things to say is that out of our
collective at Stanford, if you look at the book, Woman, Culture, and Society,

68

what it argues is that even though in lots of places women have a lot of
power, we couldn’t find any society where they enjoyed the kind of
authority that men had, the kind of sense that they had the right to tell other
people what to do, that they had the right to be--they may be able to have
done it, but that they always--. There’s that quote from Margaret Mead that
whatever men did, even if it meant hunting hummingbirds, that everybody
thought that was the most wonderful thing in the world to do.
So that’s what we kind of thought here. On the East Coast, the
women feminist anthropology collective centered in New York thought
[that they were truly egalitarian societies]. They were much more Marxist
and much more doctrinaire Marxists. Nobody ever seriously took the idea
that there had been matriarchies. [01:42:03] But they did think that there had
been egalitarian societies, whereas we on the West Coast thought that while
there were places where men and women were fairly equal, that if men
hunted hummingbirds even women thought that was the most wonderful
thing. And even if [women] hunted a hummingbird, people just ate the
hummingbird, and that was that, as opposed to celebrating it. [laughs]
Torre: Okay. Did you consider yourself a Marxist?
Collier: Yes. George told me you asked that question. Yes.
Torre: And what did it mean then? Because I have read things that do not indicate
that there was a uniform definition.
Collier: Of Marxism. [laughs]
Torre: [laughs] Of a Marxist anthropologist. So it seems to have actually a lot of
latitude in what that might mean. I ask the question because Shelly was

69

identified as a Marxist anthropologist in one of the things I was reading.
That’s why I asked about it.
Collier: [01:43:07]Yes. No, I certainly consider myself--yes. Well, Bridget O’Laughlin
came to us at Stanford. Again, I don’t remember exactly what year Bridget
was hired.
Torre: I think it was 1974 maybe.
Collier: 1974? Okay. Bridget was trained at Yale but had also studied in France,
where there was a very active Marxist anthropology. She wrote Marxism.
The whole thing about Marxism was it hadn’t been taught in this country.
When I was in college, we got to read The Communist Manifesto. We were told
it was all wrong and so forget the whole thing. [laughs]
Then [what would have] gone under the name of Marxist
anthropology [in the US] was sort of mindless economic determinism kind
of stuff. Once you started learning about French Marxists and the European
Marxist traditions, these provided a much more complex set of interests and
of how inequality works.
[01:44:05] That’s really what we were doing with feminist
anthropology, was sort of trying to understand the nature of inequality and
what kept it in place and why did women go along with it, actually.
Actually, through the 1970s, anthropology was going through this,
again, destruction because of the Vietnam War. The anthropology that was
taught in the 1950s and early 1960s was very much focused on the idea that
social systems were in balance and equilibrium and that [societies] were

70

good for people. Obviously, people do benefit if they have [laughs] a social
system that works.
[01:45:04] Through the 1970s, there became a whole questioning of
anthropology’s role in colonialism and in suppressing people and writing
books that enabled British colonial officials to manage African societies and
stuff. But also the whole ferment that came out of the opposition to the
Vietnam War sort of questioned that, “Hey, maybe social systems aren’t so
good for everybody. Maybe some people do a whole lot better in social
systems than other people.”
In a sense, the whole field of anthropology changed from seeing
customs as being what they were because they served some useful social
purpose and benefited everybody, to maybe some customs were there
because they benefitted some people a whole lot more than they benefitted
other people. [laughs]
[01:46:03] So that was really a major switch in anthropology.
Torre: Seeing everything through the lens of exploitation.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: A word that became very popular.
Collier: Yes. Although, I guess I never thought about it as exploitation. I was more
interested in inequality--and actually, what basically my shtick has been--I
hate the term equality. What I would really like is a vocabulary to be able to
talk about varieties of inequalities. Obviously there are inequalities that we
approve of like parents and children. There are inequalities that we think are
good and right. Then there are inequalities that we don’t think [are just].

71

And it’s a whole spectrum. But we only have this vocabulary of unequal and
equal.
[01:46:58] I’ve always tried to fight--well, my book was trying to
understand different ways of organizing inequality. We’re always going to
have inequalities. But how are they organized? How are they perpetuated?
[laughs] Indeed, some of them are much worse than others. How do we
think about it? We need a vocabulary to be able to make finer moral
distinctions than we have. Anyway, so that’s where I’m coming from.
Torre: But what you’re saying is that that was a movement nationally.
Collier: Movement nationally. Yes.
Torre: In anthropology. So in terms of having that focus of interest among social
cultural anthropologists, that viewpoint became quite accepted.
Collier: Yes. And feminism fit right in. Yes.
Torre: And feminism fit right in.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: Well, can you tell me about the interplay of these new theories in
anthropology or in the developing field of what became feminist studies and
the practical situation of female professors at Stanford? Did you discuss
inequities in pay and benefits? Did you strategize together?
Collier: [01:48:11] No. I don’t remember that being discussed. [laughs] I was half
time, and I wasn’t getting any benefits. But again, it was George who fought
for all of that. George did the financial side of our family. I guess you had to
be three-quarters time or something to get benefits. I was half.
Torre: Do you mean that Shelly Rosaldo got benefits?

72

Collier: Yes, I think so. Yes. Because she was three-quarters. But I did not because I
was only half time.
Torre: Is that the reason? Or is it because you were a woman?
Collier: No, no, no. It was because of the half time. Yes. Stanford did not [give
benefits to half-time employees] because I guess they had various part-time
people through the staff and everything, they did not want to change their
benefits policy. Because it cost a lot more money than just me. [laughs] But
I think they finally did.
So you got proportional benefits. So I did--at the end--get benefits. I
remember--well, no. I guess I don’t know what position Artie Bienenstock
had. But I guess we were talking--George, again, sort of fighting for more
pay and stuff like that. And Artie was saying, “Jane, don’t worry. If
something happens to George, we’ll take care of you.” [laughs]
Torre: Who was that again?
Collier: Artie Bienenstock. [laughs] There was that thing going on at Stanford. Even
all through my career there was--when it came to handing out pay raises, it
was justified as men had families to support whereas a woman like me, I had
a husband who was supporting me. I didn’t need the pay raise. Whereas [a
raise] mattered a whole lot to this man who had children.
Torre: What year was that being said?
Collier: Oh, this was all the way on through.
Torre: Through when? Through the 1970s?
Collier: Through the 1980s into the 1990s. Yes.
Torre: Really?

73

Collier: Yes.
Torre: I can remember that being said, but not in the 1990s. [laughs]
Collier: [laughs] Yes.
Torre: Interesting.
Collier: No. I guess I was just-Torre: When you say you didn’t get benefits, are you thinking of medical benefits
or pension benefits or--?
Collier: Yes. Those were the sort of benefits package that faculty got, yes.
Torre: All of it? So what ultimately you got was that at 50 percent it was a pro-rata.
Collier: Again, you’d have to ask George. I’m terrible because he’s the one who
negotiated all this. I was so grateful just to have a job and be able to have an
intellectual life.
Torre: [01:51:02] I do understand that. How did your political concerns direct your
research? And how did your research inform your political views? I
shouldn’t say direct, but what was the interplay of those?
Collier: I never thought of myself as a very political person. My research was
interested in inequality. I guess I’d always been a Democrat.
Feminism, I don’t know if you remember, but there were debates
between liberal feminists and Marxist feminists, and more radical [queer]
feminists, and they were going into critiques of liberalism. I really did do a
lot of the participation in critiques of liberalism, the sort of, “Do we really
just want to make women like men? Or do we want to change the world?”

74

[01:52:03] In which caring and compassion get [laughs] paid for, and
so the recognition that childcare and caring for the environment have
economic values as opposed to cutting down all the trees.
Torre: So given that, you saw yourself more on the Marxist end?
Collier: More on the Marxist side. Yes.
Torre: Okay. I noticed in looking through some of your files on classes that the
name of the class that you started teaching with Michelle Rosaldo actually
changed over the 1970s. It changed from “Women in Cross Cultural
Perspective” to, in 1978, “Sex Roles in Cross Cultural Perspective” and then
I think later to “Sex Roles and Society.”
Collier: Yes.
Torre: [01:52:58] I was curious about that. Why the name changed and whether the
people who took the course perhaps changed over the decade, as well? Did
more men take the course in 1980 than in 1970?
Collier: I don’t remember the students. I genuinely don’t remember. It had a lot to
do--we always had women taking it, and whether men took it or not had to
do with whether it filled a distribution requirement. That change of name
reflects--it started out as “Women in Cross Cultural Perspective” because
that whole collective was trying to figure out what on earth women did. The
first courses were really focused on saying, “Hey. Look. In this place there
are queens. In this place women run the economy.” That kind of thing. As
we went along, what we realized was that we were also looking at men as
well, that men were often unequal, [laughs] particularly young men often
were unequal in the world.

75

[01:54:04] Old women often got very powerful. So again, trying to
look at both men and women, recognizing that men have a gender as well.
So trying to look at masculinity as well as femininity. So that’s why that
changed into “sex roles” as being much more about [the fact] that men are
part of the equation, too. Although, it did start out as that focus on, “Hey,
we don’t know what women do. Let’s find out.”
Torre: The Center for Research on Women, often called CROW, was founded in
1974, also the same year that the book was published on Woman, Culture and
Society. What was your involvement with CROW in the 1970s?
Collier: [01:54:56] That was the meeting place for women from across the
disciplines. It was a really wonderful space because what it sponsored was
women from different disciplines talking about what feminism meant in
their disciplines and what they were bringing to it. That was just really
exciting and forged bonds across departments. With English I have a
lifelong friendship with Ann Mellor. And Diane Middlebrook was there.
Then from Psychology, Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Jacklin. Just
people coming together from different disciplines then talking about what
feminism and a focus on women had meant to their fields. It was really an
intellectually exciting place. It also had a lecture series. Again, they would
have different ones of us give lectures and stuff.
Torre: [01:56:07] Did the center grow out of the work of the collaborative in
anthropology at all? Or was it just an independent activity that you then got
swept up into?

76

Collier: As I recall, the latter. But I don’t know. Shelly may have been really
important in it. Again, Shelly didn’t have her children till later. [laughs] So
Shelly was much more active. Shelly also had all those really deep
connections to women in New York and Harvard and also in Berkeley in a
way that I didn’t have. I was much more home bound. Yes.
Torre: How was the focus of CROW different from Feminist Studies?
Collier: CROW was focused on research. Then CROW, because it became a--what
are they? An institute or something or other--needed funding. So they
would try to involve wealthy women from the region to contribute money.
CROW focused more and more on bringing in research scholars and doing
research and then trying to raise money from wealthy donors and that kind
of thing.
Feminist Studies then went on to develop a teaching program. So
there really was that kind of split in institutional space. Also then Feminist
Studies became more and more radical. CROW had become more and more
sort of mainstream because of the donor base.
Torre: So Feminist Studies became an interdisciplinary major in 1981.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: [01:58:02] Clearly there must have been some advocacy on that subject
starting earlier than that. Were the people who were initially involved with
CROW also people who were advocating for an interdisciplinary Feminist
Studies?
Collier: Yes.
Torre: And what was your involvement with that?

77

Collier: Again, I was much more on the periphery. Shelly was very deeply involved
in all that. I didn’t get tenure until 1981. So I was busy trying to write. Shelly
was, too, obviously, since she got tenure earlier than that. She was very
much more active in that kind of stuff than I was.
Torre: You were fifty percent. Shelly was seventy-five percent. I noticed that
George came up for tenure after the normal six years.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: Which was fairly typical at that time. How many years did it take Shelly to
get tenure? And did that relate to the seventy-five percent or not?
Collier: [01:59:09] I think it did to some extent. But then Shelly was also becoming a
superstar in anthropology. Fields have stars, and Shelly was clearly on the
trajectory to become a star. She was nationally known. She came up for
tenure early, and she had the credentials to be [laughs] somebody that would
obviously get tenure.
Torre: I’m going to back up a little bit in time before we go on to 1981. In 1973,
ten women were elected to the 53-member faculty senate. Previously there
had only been two women. Then in 1974 you were elected to the senate
academic council. You were very busy at the time. Why did you take that
on? What was it like?
Collier: [02:00:02] Again, I don’t have a lot of memories. It met, what, every other
week or something on Thursday afternoons or something. I would go. It
was interesting. The two issues that I remember that came up--one was the
Reagan Library. Remember Reagan was sort of-Torre: That was a bit later. That was in the 1980s.

78

Collier: Was it? Oh. Because I sort of remember being on the faculty senate then.
Torre: I’m sure that that was a big issue later. It’s not in the 1970s.
Collier: Okay. Well, then the other issue would have been in the 1980s, too, which
was the sort of redoing Western Civ.
Torre: Right. That’s actually quite late. That’s 1988. Let’s hold that to next time.
Collier: Next time. [laughs] Okay.
Torre: Well, how-Collier: But those are the two things I remember [laughs] from the senate.
Torre: [02:00:58] Not speaking of specific issues because not every year has a big
issue, but how were women regarded on the committees? Did you face any
stereotypes?
Collier: Again, not that I remember. But I am basically a quiet, shy person. I
probably behaved like the stereotypical woman. I wasn’t fighting anything.
[laughs]
Torre: I had read other women say that at that time that there was a widespread
view that women were not good at committee work, and that was a
stereotype. But it may not have affected you.
Collier: The committees that I was involved in that I really cared about were
SWOPSI. Then I was involved a lot in CROW.
[02:01:59] I was also on the committee that approved the--I’ve
forgotten what they were called. They were faculty-initiated courses or
people who wanted to initiate a special course. I’ve forgotten what the thing
was called. Those were things I cared about and did. I wasn’t on any of the

79

main committees until I got on the [Committee on Committees], which I
found was a total bore. [laughs]
Torre: Well, the reason I asked is you said you were enormously busy,
understandably, and that you weren’t especially political. But you put
yourself in this early environment in 1974. So I wondered whether you were
talked into it by other women or whether you thought-Collier: Don’t remember.
Torre: Don’t remember.
Collier: Don’t remember.
Torre: [laughs] Okay. We’ll leave that.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: [02:03:02] I read a 1977 interview of Stanford professional couples. One
professor worried that part-time work would undoubtedly result in
exploitation since the person would work more than half-time, and
especially was saying this with regard to research. So I would like to know
more about your teaching load and whether you were exploited. You’ve
talked a bit about the benefits and how that changed. Did people lean on
you for more committee work and more teaching than really was a half-time
load?
Collier: Yes. No, no. But I knew that. That was what one expected. One was
grateful to have the opportunity. [laughs]
Torre: I do understand. [laughs] So describe your progress toward tenure. I believe
you got that in 1981.
Collier: Yes.

80

Torre: [02:04:01] That’s about ten years after you had started teaching classes at
Stanford and nine years after you were a half-time professor. Tell me why it
took that period of time.
Collier: Basically the tenure clock was very slow because I was half time. If the
normal time was six years, it was assumed to be twelve years kind of thing.
Torre: So we should really think of this as coming faster?
Collier: [laughs] Sooner than half time, yes.
Torre: [laughs] There were other people who had half-time appointments. You
spoke of Shelly. But there were other people in other departments perhaps.
Do you know whether that path was typical for women?
Collier: I honestly don’t know of anybody else who had a half-time appointment.
Torre: I see. Do you know whether other women faced longer tenure track time
periods than six years?
Collier: [02:05:05] I honestly don’t know. I really don’t know.
Torre: At that time, were all of the male colleagues getting tenure at the six-year
point?
Collier: Or coming up for tenure? I think so. Yes. I think it was on the regular
schedule. Yes.
Torre: So Renato was a three-quarter time appointment, which--splitting it with
Shelly. Did he come up for tenure in six years?
Collier: I honestly don’t--again, I’m terrible on this stuff. No, I don’t know all this
stuff.
Torre: It’s a question about a different professor. I don’t know that you--forgive
me for asking.

81

Collier: I know Renato came up after George, but I think it was again on that sixyear kind of time period.
Torre: Well, he came later than George.
Collier: He came later than George. Yes.
Torre: [02:05:57] Do you think that your active involvement with CROW and
Feminist Studies--what became the Feminist Studies major, did your
involvement in establishing that help you receive tenure? Or was it a
neutral?
Collier: I think basically pretty neutral. Getting tenure at Stanford has always been
[based on research]. You can’t have awful teaching reviews but if you’re a
rave teacher, maybe it helps, but not all that much. My teaching reviews
were never rave, but they were always just sort of decent. It was really
research that counted. Research was what mattered. [laughs] Research and a
national reputation were what mattered. Yes.
Torre: You have published considerably. I understand that Estelle Freedman, a
historian who helped co-found the Feminist Studies [program], experienced
a very contentious tenure fight.
Collier: Oh, did she. Yes.
Torre: [02:07:03] In 1983. This is slightly jumping ahead, but it’s a related topic.
Are you more familiar with what she went through?
Collier: Yes.
Torre: Tell me about that.
Collier: Oh. Because Estelle, her research was basically feminist women’s history.
The History Department, I think, was a lot more hide bound than

82

Anthropology. Actually, she got denied tenure. A bunch of us--I think I-even had a “Tenure Estelle Freedman” t-shirt at one point. A bunch of us
[laughs] were concerned. As I understood it, it came to light in an e-mail in
which a male professor had said, “We can’t have women’s history. We can’t
tenure this person.” [laughs] So then Stanford realized that they’d be facing
kind of major lawsuits, and Estelle had a national reputation as a major
feminist scholar and so on.
[02:08:06] They gave her tenure. But it was really that. It was a
backlash against women’s history. Because in history, political and economic
history and history of wars and stuff had always been the major thing.
Women’s history was way down, and a lot of men looked down on it.
Torre: So it was people above the department at the dean and president level that
overrode the [decision].
Collier: I think so. Yes.
Torre: Or did they ask it to be revisited, and the History Department reversed
itself?
Collier: I honestly don’t remember what finally led to tenure, but I remember there
was a major movement of, as I said, “Tenure Estelle Freedman” t-shirts and
things. [laughs]
Torre: Well, you mentioned there that you thought the History Department was
more hide bound than Anthropology. The Anthropology Department, later
on and in the 1980s, certainly went out and recruited a lot of minority
students and minority faculty-Collier: Yes.

83

Torre: [02:09:12]--at least in comparison to the rest of the school of social sciences.
Collier: Yes. It did.
Torre: So did the Anthropology Department always feel welcoming to you? Or was
there a shift in the culture over the 1970s?
Collier: The divide in Anthropology was really between people who were trained in
the 1950s and [those trained in the 60s and beyond]. After World War II,
[because of] the GI Bill, a lot of the men got to go to college and then on to
graduate studies in anthropology. It was that anthropology that was focused
on seeing societies as functioning wholes and that if there was a custom, it
was good for society. Sort of perpetuating society.
[02:10:05] Conflict was bad and so on. So the divide in [cultural]
anthropology is [between] the people trained then who were trying to look
at societies as consensus and good and the people who came of age in the
1970s when there was a lot of questioning of anthropology, its role in
colonialism, sort of starting to look at inequality, and so on. So that’s been
the major divide within cultural anthropology. In some places it was
extremely painful.
At Harvard there was just a major horrible experience with graduate
students against the faculty, with the graduate students criticizing the faculty
for their involvement in exploitation [laughs] and all of this kind of--you can
imagine what it was like.
[02:10:54] Fortunately George and I got out of Harvard before that.
We managed to switch over into the new anthropology of looking at
conflict and thinking about societies as being, “Hey, maybe they’re better

84

for some people [laughs] than they are for other folks.” And do it--and also
look at history because anthropology didn’t look at history [back then]. It
looked at societies as functioning wholes now. But the focus on inequality
started as, “Hey, wait a minute. When did this custom come in? Who [did it
benefit]? What’s the history of how did it start?”
George and I managed to make a lot of that transition and keep our
good relations with senior faculty, whereas the generation maybe four years
younger than us--Professor Vogt’s students who would--he really broke
with them. It was horrible conflict. That’s the divide within cultural
anthropology.
Torre: [02:11:56] Thank you for explaining that. Can you tell me--again thinking of
1969 to early 1980s, not going on to the later 1980s for a moment, but can
you tell me how affirmative action developed and changed in that period as
you experienced it in your department and with CROW?
Collier: I guess my experience was that Anthropology was very much for affirmative
action and really was for trying to get diversity into the department and
really was trying to bring in students, to train students from diverse
backgrounds. That commitment of Anthropology focuses on cultural
diversity [laughs].
Torre: [02:12:59] So in terms of the faculty and administrative attitudes to
feminism and to feminist studies, how did that change from 1970 to the
early 1980s?

85

Collier: Again, I experienced that we received a lot of support. Ben Paul was the
chair of Anthropology for a long time. He was incredibly supportive of the
women faculty.
Torre: Then in terms of the students, that’s a twelve-year period. The people you
were teaching in 1971 were coming to a very new field. By 1981 a little bit
different. How did the students respond to your classes and topics?
Collier: No, it is interesting because at the beginning we were getting all of these
women who were sort of--feminist consciousness was awakened, and they
were interested.
[02:14:00] For two or three years we had students who were really
with us. There was a year when Shelly went away and I was teaching the
course. All of a sudden I ended up with a bunch of women who wanted to
be wives and mothers. [laughs] It was one of the most horrible courses I
ever taught. The agonizing thing when you realize that your students are not
with you, and they do not want to hear what you have to say.
After that it was really interesting. I changed my teaching style a lot to
try and figure out where the class was and what they wanted and what they
thought--because often I did have to tell them things they didn’t want to
know. I think it’s still true that while you’re in college you have a lot of
equality as a woman. But if you dare to have a baby, things tend to change.
It’s hard for a woman to--you really are often one man away from poverty
and destitution.
[02:15:05] They don’t want to hear that, of course. Trying to find a
way to bring people with me, to bring students with me to where they could

86

understand that this is the reality, but doesn’t have to be their reality. You
better know this reality so you can learn to deal with it. I changed my
teaching style a lot, to opening up classrooms to questions, to trying to
sponsor discussions, to really trying to gauge where they were coming from
before I knew what I wanted to teach them.
But I often had to get there in circuitous ways of trying to make sure
that they were along with me and following the path and so they understood
where it was coming from.
Torre: It sounds like you wanted to bring the topics of inequality in the societies
you were looking at back home to them.
Collier: [02:16:02] Oh, yes.
Torre: It was always related to the US experience, as well.
Collier: Yes.
Torre: Why don’t we stop here for now?
Collier: Okay. All right.

INTERVIEWER:

DINA ASFAHA

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

JULY 21, 2017

Asfaha: This is Dina Asfaha with the Stanford Historical Society’s oral history
program. I am here today, July 21st, 2017, at the Oakland, California home
of Stanford University’s Jane Collier, Emerita Professor of Cultural and
Social Anthropology. We are conducting this interview as part of the
Stanford Pioneering Women Oral History Project.
Okay, Dr. Collier, I want to start off with going back to the 1970s. I
wanted to ask you, did developments in affirmative action and the women’s
movement intersect with your research and teaching? I know you were able
to collaborate with other women scholars such as Shelly Rosaldo, June Starr,
Sylvia Yanagisako, and you participated in the Stanford Women’s Teaching
Collective in 1970.
[00:01:00] Can you talk a little bit about how those events
surrounding women’s issues affected how you crafted the syllabus for your
“Women and Cross-Cultural Perspectives” course?
Collier: Actually, the Women and Cross-Cultural Perspective course was when I
was--it must have been in 1971. And Shelly Rosaldo and I were both at

89

Stanford as either post-docs or writing dissertations. We both had PhDs.
And there were several women graduate students, Julia Howell, Ellen Lewin,
[also Kim Kramer and Janet Fjellman], you know it’s in the book, Women,
Culture, and Society.
But anyway, all of us were realizing, again, stimulated by the women’s
movement, that anthropology at that time [ignored women], there was a
book that had been written that everybody was reading--Robin Fox’s Kinship
and Marriage: An Anthropological Perspective [1967].
[00:02:00] Fox’s whole story about kinship was that the women
basically stayed home and took care of the children, did the cooking and
washed the clothes while the men did everything else. Obviously, we were
women in anthropology, and we decided it made sense to look at what in
fact women were doing.
So this group of us--I think there were six or eight of us--got
together. I don’t know how often, once a week or something like that. We
divided up and read ethnographies and really talked about what women
were in fact doing. We found they were doing] all kinds of things like
queens in Africa, women who ran markets, women who did [the farming].
What came out of that was then the sort of planning for a group-taught
course. I think maybe that course was in fact taught in 1971.
[00:02:57] And maybe we were also meeting with some other women
at our stage of career, you know, as graduate students or living in the area,
like Nancy Chodorow, who was at Berkeley and things like that. So again,
I’m unclear on the details, but there were a group of us and we were talking

90

to people in Berkeley and were meeting. And what came out of our
Stanford group was the sense that while we could look at, see that women
were doing all kinds of things, that it always seemed that men got the
prestige, that whatever was the most prestigious thing to do in the world, it
was men that did it. Even though it looked like there were societies where
women basically had enormous amounts of power and would be pretty
egalitarian, when it came to prestige and authority--the power and ability to
get things done--men always were credited with having the prestige.
[00:04:03] There was that wonderful quote from Margaret Mead
that’s in the front of Women, Culture, and Society about whatever men did, be
it hunting hummingbirds, that it was the most prestigious thing to do in
society.
So we built a course that basically--I’m sure the syllabi are still around
because I think they got turned into the Stanford archives. I don’t
remember the course now, but I think it was organized by areas of the
world and talking about what women did, but then with the sort of final
conclusion that, “Look, women do all of these kinds of things. You can’t
just say they took care of babies and the cooking.” But wherever you
looked, men seemed to have prestige. And why was that? How do we think
about that? And so that was the basis of the Women, Culture and Society book.
[00:04:58] Actually, Ben Paul’s wife, Lois Paul, was part of that group
too. So there were a bunch of us all talking. And that was the issue; what
started it was [the question], “What in fact are women really doing?” Do we
know? What do we [as anthropologists] know about what women do? So we

91

put together the course. And then Shelly Rosaldo, along with Louise
Lamphere, organized the book, collected the essays for the book. And the
book came out.
And virtually at the same time, but maybe a year later, Reyna Rapp
and some of the people in New York were also doing the same kind of
thing, but were very much more influenced by Marxism than we. They had
argued very strongly that there had been egalitarian societies in the past or
even now. [00:05:57] Nobody that I know of ever argued that there had
been a quote, unquote, “matriarchy a la Engels.” But they did sort of say
that we [at Stanford] were wrong. So there was this sort of debate between
Stanford and New York. Stanford, Berkeley, West Coast versus East Coast-on whether there ever had been truly egalitarian societies or whether in
every society whatever was prestigious to do, men seemed to be able to do it
as opposed to women. That was kind of fun and that went on for quite a
while.
But the course was basically established then as this collective that
taught it. Shelly and me and some graduate students. And we taught the
course, and then Shelly and I, when we got appointed to the faculty, kept on
teaching it together. When one of us was away, the other would teach it.
[00:07:02] So you were asking how the course came to be; that’s how
the course came to be. And over time we changed it. I guess it started off
being called “Women in Cross-Cultural Perspective.” Then eventually we
changed it to “Sex Roles and Society” and taught it for many years. So that’s
kind of that story.

92

At the same time that all this was going on in Anthropology, which
was really fun and exciting, the whole university [was changing], they were
getting wonderful people in English and Psychology and so on. There were
those meetings that turned eventually into the Center for Research on
Women [CROW]. I’m not sure how often we met. Looking back at my
calendars it looks like a fair amount. But people would talk from different
disciplines as to what was going on in their discipline.
[00:07:54] So we would hear from Psychology, Eleanor Maccoby and
Carol Jacklin, and then History, Estelle [Estelle Freedman] came in at some
point in there and talked about women’s history. Literature, we had
wonderful people; Anne Mellor and Diane Middlebrook and all in English.
So it was really exciting across the disciplines as well, a very exciting time to
be here.
Asfaha: Absolutely. What was it like to be engaged in these conversations about
gender and women’s rights at this time in the classroom with a group of
students, with these young people, while the sort of sociopolitical fabric of
the United States was undergoing a major change? Was there a lot of
tension in the classroom between your male and female students for
example?
Collier: [00:08:58] Well, we didn’t have very many male students obviously, when it
was called “Women in Cross-Cultural Perspective.”
Asfaha: That’s interesting.
Collier: Or even in Feminist Studies classes. We did have a few, but not very many.
Mostly it was good because the people who came were the women who

93

wanted to know. Although there was one year when I taught it and
somehow I got off on the wrong foot, and I ended up with a classroom full
of women who wanted to be just like mother and stay home. And that was a
disaster. And I’m not entirely sure of the dynamics that led to that or how I
managed to antagonize the class. But that was one of my worst teaching
experiences and after that I got much better at figuring out where students
were coming from. Because my teaching philosophy had always been to try
and--well, one has to learn a lot about teaching, because nobody teaches
you.
[00:10:00] I learned it was really important to try and figure out where
[the students] were, to sort of start slowly and lead them step-by-step to
where I wanted to go, as opposed to telling them what I wanted them to
know before I knew where they were coming from and, therefore, what I
would have to overcome. So that was there.
And then as time went on and the Human Biology Program got
established, I guess my biggest problem was people who had been to
Human Biology courses and learned about what they thought were the
physical and mental differences between males and females. And so they
came. They would come to the class and sort of make pronouncements
about women being inherently more maternal and all this kind of stuff. Of
course, obviously, I was teaching that those ideas were totally cultural.
[00:11:00] It’s very funny, I always talk about how I spent most of my
career fighting against biological determinism. But, as in later years
creationism came in, I find myself defending evolution [laughter]. And so

94

while I deeply do believe in evolution and do believe that there are
biological differences, biology doesn’t determine the culture; it’s really the
culture that determines. At least for me and for Shelly. What we wrote about
really was that the culture in which we live determines which aspects of your
biology are going to make a difference. So it determines how people
interpret biology and therefore warrants possibilities. Anyway, that was kind
of the women’s situation.
Asfaha: [00:11:52] And in that class or that quarter where you had a majority of
young women maybe whose ideas about womanhood and motherhood were
a little bit more narrow, do you feel as though after taking your class they
were able to expand their ideas there?
Collier: Sometimes you have classes that just don’t go, and that one did not go. I
guess my memory is in the early years, except for that time, we pretty much
had students who wanted to learn this stuff and were fun to teach. And then
as time went on and the women’s movement had taken hold, and they were
still teaching gender and society and stuff like that, the women who came in
thought, or in their own experience, they had never had any restrictions.
[00:12:57] And so when teaching, we tried to teach them that--I guess
this was in Feminist Studies 101, I would have a fellow faculty member
come in who was a single mother. And she talked about how on her
Stanford salary as an assistant professor she could not pay the rent, child
care, and eat; she could only do two of those three. The students did not
want to hear that because they had bought the message that if you’re a
woman you can do anything. [I was] really trying to teach them that having

95

children puts women, in our society anyway--and in fact virtually, this is one
of the very few societies where having children is bad for women--it puts
them in a much more vulnerable position.
[00:13:55] In fact, again, for anthropology, in most societies in the
world, it’s through having children that women gain power. In our society
women’s power goes down considerably if they have children.
Asfaha: And so on that note, can you talk a little bit about what it was like balancing
work and family while on the tenure track? So your children were a little bit
older at this point, and so you were a lot more deeply entrenched and I
guess had more time to focus on your career--or maybe you didn’t. Can you
talk a little bit more about that?
Collier: When I got offered the tenure track position, the dean’s office was offering
tenure track positions for hiring women and minorities. [00:14:58] So what
Ben Paul, the chair of our department, did was he got one full-time position
and he divided it between Shelly and me. So Renato and Shelly--Renato
having come much later and they not having children yet, divided their oneand-a-half times. They divided one-and-a-half between them--each three
quarters, yes. George and I, because George had already been teaching for I
guess three years or something, if he had to go down a quarter time, it
would have been a big cut in his salary. So he stayed full-time, and I stayed
half-time. I was working half-time, and that made me feel free that I could
go home when my kids got home from school.
[00:15:53] Also we were living in the Stanford ghetto, and that was a
wonderful place for bringing up children. Very safe. They could walk to

96

school, bicycle to school. They were safe. I could come home and be with
them, and they could play outside. So the kinds of trouble that people have
with children and working I didn’t really have.
Asfaha: Moving on from there, in 1974 you were elected to the senate. Can you talk
a little bit about what it was like to enter a new space and on campus as a
different type of influence and what your role was there and whether being a
woman affected your say or how you were able to create or implement any
new policies?
Collier: [00:17:00] I can’t tell you. I don’t remember anything about that. [Laughter]
I remember going and sitting through the faculty senate. I was only [on it]
twice I think. As I told you, I don’t remember what came up when. But I
was on the senate when there was the debate about changing from
“Western Civilization” to “Cultures, Ideas, and Values.” My experience of
that--which got portrayed in the newspapers as, “Stanford is killing
Shakespeare and Dante” and things--my experience of that was that it was,
again, basically a generational shift, that the people who had founded the
Western Civ [curriculum] were the senior people in English and History and
so on. They grew up with the idea of great books. But the younger people
coming in in those fields were growing up in a culture where both English
and history were trying to look at the wider contexts in which works were
set. The younger people objected to teaching Dante and Shakespeare
separate from each other. They wanted to teach texts as much more
embedded in history and other texts. So that was my experience of what it
was, that it was basically this kind of generational fight. It was also students

97

who objected to being taught Western Civilization. They wanted more of
the rest of the ideas of the world, what had come out of Asia and Africa. So
the “Culture, Ideas and Values” track was very much built around trying to
incorporate a much wider sense of the world than just Greece and Rome
and Europe and the US, the great books.
[00:19:09] As I say, my experience was that the younger English
professors and the younger history professors did not like teaching books
out of their historical and social contexts. So that was what I thought
happened.
Asfaha: And do you feel that the Anthropology Department had a strong opinion
on where this debate or curriculum would go?
Collier: Of course we did, yes. Anthropology set up a series called--I forget what it
was called. But anyway, it was a series of three courses. And the first one
was called “Origins,” which looked at origin stories. It put the Gilgamesh
epic and the Christian epic and African epics and Navajo epics, about the
creation of the world--and also Darwinism. It talked about creation and the
ideas about how things got created. So you could teach great books. You
could teach the Bible, you could teach Darwin and so on, but you were
teaching about how they were all talking about the origins of things.
And then I guess the second one was called “Encounters.” And so
the first part “Origins” looked at “ancient” history up through feudalism
and stuff like that. And then the second course, the “Encounters” took up
from the 16th century on through. “Encounters” was about the European
encounters with other cultures and other cultures’ encounters with each

98

other. So it gave a global sense of history and where works fit into these
encounters between different cultures and so on.
[00:21:00] Then the last part of it was called “Identities,” which Sylvia
[Sylvia Yanagisako] and I taught for years. And that took again basically
from the Enlightenment on and talked about how we think about identities
of nations, of people, and these kinds of things. It was a fantastic course
sequence and apparently it was very popular. There was a lot of backlash
against anthropologists teaching what had once been Western Civ on the
grounds that anthropologists had no values--we were cultural relativists and
so we don’t believe in anything. Which of course is a total misconception,
but anyway.
Asfaha: Absolutely. [Laughter]
Collier: Yes. But you can imagine, you know the press and some of the more
conservative people were against that.
[00:21:57] The other thing about “Culture, Ideas, and Values” was
that it was always supposed to incorporate looking at race, class, and
gender--I guess as sort of things that cut across everything. And again, what
our experience was was that Stanford has a lot of very wealthy students that
come from wealthy families, and a bunch of them did not want their kids
being faced with race, class, and gender--inequality. They wanted them to
learn Shakespeare and Dante and become civilized that way. So we were
getting some backlash from that. Although, as I say, students apparently
loved the anthropology sequence, or they liked it better than they liked a lot
of the other ones.

99

Asfaha: [00:22:51] Moving on from there, I was actually a little bit interested to hear,
you said that one of the challenges of going from Western Civ to Cultures,
Ideas, and Values was the pressure from parents of kids I guess sort of the
elite and them wanting their children to learn about the “classics” of
Western Civilization. What was it like to be an ambassador to the university
as someone on the senate and how did you approach or quell these worries
of the parents?
Collier: That actually came up later I think, after “Culture, Ideas, and Values” had
been going on a while. And I don’t remember that I had much say in the
switchover. Obviously I had my loyalties, which was with the younger
faculty, of which I was one. You know, that’s who we were. It was the
younger faculty.
[00:24:04] But it was really after “Culture, Ideas, and Values” had
been going for several years that the university seemed to be getting more
conservative.
Asfaha: So in 1981 you were granted tenure for your time here at Stanford. But just
after being given tenure came the case of Steven Mosher, who was a
Stanford graduate student in anthropology conducting field research in rural
China. Right after you had gotten tenure, you headed a departmental
committee that investigated whether Steven Mosher had engaged in illegal
and unethical conduct wherein he endangered his research subjects. And
eventually the department voted unanimously to expel Mosher from the
university in 1983. So I am interested to hear a little bit about what your

100

thoughts were upon being asked to chair this committee and why you
accepted it.
Collier: I accepted it because I didn’t have much choice. They had just given me
tenure, and one expects that once you get tenure--they are kind to you
before you get tenure because they want you to write. But once you get
tenure, they have the right to ask you to do things to contribute to the
department because you’re no longer in danger of losing your job, et cetera.
I got appointed to this because my field was legal anthropology, which is the
anthropology of how other people settle disputes. So I was the logical
choice to do that.
[00:25:58] As far as I know, I’d never had Steven Mosher as a
student. He came in and worked very closely with the China specialists in
our department, but he didn’t really have much to do with other people very
much. So I didn’t really know him, but I was appointed to lead this
committee. There were three of us. So there was me, there was Tom Grey
from the Law School, and then Joe Greenberg from our department. Have
you heard of Joe Greenberg? A very famous elderly linguist. Very, very
famous. Most famous for doing the languages of Africa.
And it turned out to be a really great committee. Because I was good
at organizing and running things. Tom Grey knew the legal stuff, and Joe
Greenberg sort of kept us in line. Because what happened--I didn’t know
Mosher. The case got dumped on us because there was a huge brouhaha in
the China scholarship community, particularly from Berkeley.

101

[00:27:03] Apparently what Mosher had done was he had visited-because this was the one-child policy in China. So they were doing abortions
on women who got pregnant with a second child and so on. He took
photos inside one of these abortion clinics of women who were visibly very
pregnant, awaiting abortions or late-term abortions. He didn’t cover their
faces, so they were recognizable. He published this in a magazine in Taiwan.
The China scholars of course had only recently gotten back into China
because China wouldn’t let anthropologists or scholars in for a long time. So
they were horrified, and indeed everybody was sort of horrified that he
didn’t cover or put pixels or something over the faces of these women.
[00:28:06] So there was this huge storm in the China community, and
I was not a China scholar. I worked in Latin America and Spain. But anyway,
it came to Anthropology. And I guess I don’t know the kind of pressures that
were put on us from the China community. But anyway, we had gotten told
we had to investigate this. I guess we were told that the China scholars were
screaming, “Throw him out.” And we said, “You have to have due process.” I
was the due process, or our committee was the due process. Joe Greenberg’s
field was languages in Africa and my field was Latin America, so none of us
were China scholars. Pretty early on it became clear that you couldn’t begin to
throw him out for having published the pictures just on the grounds that,
frankly, students are students; they make mistakes. And as long as they realize
what they’ve done and realize you shouldn’t do that again, everybody is
entitled to learning mistakes. If you do something in what you think is good

102

faith, and it turns out to have been the wrong thing, then you really shouldn’t
be thrown out.
But in investigating Mosher, it eventually became more and more
apparent that the guy was an utter sleaze ball, at least to me and to Tom Grey.
And that’s why it was really important to have Joe Greenberg on the
committee, because Joe Greenberg wanted everything shipshape.
So basically we spent a year interviewing people who had known
Mosher through his research. Then at the end of the year I wrote up the
report of our findings, which were recommending that he should be thrown
out and saying that, you know, not for the pictures but for the other stuff that
we uncovered that he had done.
[00:30:15] It was a fairly thick report. We gave it, obviously, to
Mosher to give him a chance to talk about it and refute it, and we gave it to
the faculty. I don’t know if I was there when [the vote happened]--because
George and I were headed off to do six months in Italy because we were
teaching in the overseas program. But anyway, the faculty read the report and
they voted, all of them, to throw him out. The thing that’s interesting about
that is by that time our faculty was deeply divided. We didn’t agree on
anything, but they all agreed to throw him out.
[00:31:00] And then the other fascinating thing about the Mosher
case was our graduate students were very combative. The idea of throwing
out a graduate student, you would have expected them to hit the roof and
organize and everything. There wasn’t a single one who stood up for
Mosher.

103

Asfaha: I can imagine.
Collier: Of course, he never published or let anybody see the report. The right wing
of course was all horrified about abortions in China and that we threw this
man out for publicizing the horrors of abortions in China. He went with
that whole narrative, that Stanford threw him out because he had done this
virtuous deed of publishing the horrors of abortions in China. Stanford
couldn’t say anything, because all we could say is, “That’s not the reason.
We can’t tell you why.” I fortunately was off in Italy. I guess somebody
from Science Magazine called me, but that was the only interview I got.
[00:32:00] Our poor chair of our department [Clifford R. Barnett] got
interviewed on television. His story about the Mosher case--because of
course nationally we had crucified this guy for doing a virtuous deed. But
Cliff Barnett had talked about how when he was interviewed, there were
two interviewers. So one would ask a question, and he would look over
there, and then the other one, he’d look. But of course the television
viewers only saw him, and he looked all shifty-eyed. [Laughter] So anyway,
that was the story of the Mosher thing. It took a year and a lot of time. But,
as I say, the really good thing was we had a good committee. Tom Grey was
fabulous on helping sort out the legal issues, and Joe Greenberg was
wonderful on, “You’ve got to prove that--you have to have more evidence.”
So it was hard, but I think we made the right decision.
Asfaha: It sounds like a very notable experience in your time as a professor here and
in the department. I imagine that’s not really common.

104

Collier: No, it is very, very uncommon. Absolutely uncommon. We’ve had other
graduate students get into trouble and stuff like that, but it’s been, like I’ve
said, people make mistakes. And more often it was the lefties who were so
enthusiastic about working with the lefty people that they endangered their
informants because they were interviewing people on the left in areas where
those people might get hurt. But this was nothing like that.
Asfaha: [00:34:06] And so following--I guess this was sort of happening at the same
time. The Feminist Studies major was founded in 1981. I wanted to hear a
little bit about your involvement in establishing this major that was cofounded by Estelle Freedman and Shelly was also--right before she passed.
Do you think that helping establish this major influenced, either helped or
hurt you, in receiving tenure, and how did the Anthropology Department
receive this new addition to the academic realm of the university?
Collier: [00:35:00] In the first place I wasn’t really very involved. In fact, I don’t
remember any involvement with the founding of Feminist Studies.
Obviously I was for it, but it was really Shelly and Estelle Freedman. I don’t
know if people from other departments, from English and stuff like that.
Because out of the CROW group, people that worked--and people were
doing a lot to sort of protect me, who didn’t have tenure yet, sort of giving
me time to write and so on. So I was not really involved in the founding of
Feminist Studies. It was only after Shelly died that I was pulled in as the
person from Anthropology. By that time I had tenure. As far as I know it
had no effect on my career or anything else. Stanford has continued to have

105

programs, and programs that respond to student needs and faculty interests,
and this was one of them.
[00:36:00] And it was great working across departments and so on. A
wonderful group of people. Exciting, fun, sharing ideas.
Asfaha: Absolutely. Following that a little bit later on--in 1993 you became the head
of the Feminist Studies program. At that point how had your career and
your experiences in the field and in the classroom affected your vision for
this major and the type of message that you were going to impart unto
students who were looking to really just dive into Feminist Studies?
Collier: I inherited the Feminist Studies program, and I was asked to lead it basically
because they couldn’t find somebody else. But that was fine. I cared about
the program and I wanted to see it flourish.
[00:37:03] So it was really basically administrative stuff, just making
sure that the classes got taught, had people who taught them, that the
paperwork and all that stuff got done. There had been CROW, the Center
for Research on Women, which had gotten us all together, which was then
sort of centered on funding research by scholars and so on who had come
there and broke off from the Feminist Studies program, which was the
undergraduate major. My vision for it as a major was always--I was pretty
sure there weren’t going to be jobs in that, but I thought it was a great
secondary major, particularly for women, but for anybody to sort of
understand the workings of society. A lot of it had been set up by Estelle
Freedman, who knew women’s history. A lot of it was centered on Feminist

106

Studies 101, which was really about current feminist theory and really
modern society.
[00:38:11] I mean, it wasn’t basically anthropology--the “Sex Roles
and Society” course continued to get taught as part of the Feminist Studies
program--but Feminist Studies 101, which was really on the history of the
women’s movement and the shape of gender and equality today and then
feminist theory, which was really quite exciting between liberal feminist
theory and leftist, Marxist feminist theory and so on. So that was what the
Feminist Studies Program did. As I say, my sense was that it was wonderful
preparation for dealing with the world, but not preparation for getting a job.
Asfaha: Did having this position allow you to perhaps mentor, advise students in a
different way than before? How did you help prepare these students
knowing that there may not have been a lot of opportunities solely coming
from that Feminist Studies major?
Collier: Again, there was a sort of general population to whom one taught, and then
there were the sort of people who were really eager to do further work. So
the general population--as I say, I taught them--you know, help you
understand the world you’re going to come into and understand the history
and so on. But there were some people who were really very strong
feminists and knowledgeable, people who were writing honors theses or
master’s theses. That’s a whole different level of work. Some of those have
gone on to lead women’s studies programs elsewhere.
[00:40:00] So there was, again, that general breakdown that you get in
any department between the people who love the field and really want to

107

work in it and the people who are there to meet distribution requirements or
because they have some slight interest. Yes.
Asfaha: A little bit after that--1998--the Anthropology Department actually split.
This tension was something that was growing and really reflected in
anthropology departments nationwide, specifically between biological and
cultural anthropology. So this was clearly a very difficult time to be here and
to have to deal with that tension and to always have to be around it. What
was your view then on this split and how do you view the situation now
looking back?
Collier: [00:41:00] In anthropology, the sort of four fields--there has been always in
a sense a split between the people who look at behaviors as mostly shaped
by culture and people who look at behaviors as shaped by our genes. So
that’s always been there. But what happened in that period that made it
particularly difficult was the split within cultural anthropology itself. And
that to me I experienced as a generational split between people who had
been trained in anthropology before the 1960s and people who had been
trained in anthropology after the 1960s. The big shift was that before the
1960s the focus, in the sense that the big question anthropology seemed to
face, was, “What keeps societies stable, what keeps them going?” After the
sixties and the experience of all the upheaval and anti-colonialism, the big
question was understanding power and how some groups have power and
others don’t. We should stop a minute because here comes my sister-in-law.
[break]

108

Asfaha: [00:42:11] So you were saying that pre-1960s was sort of the focus on what
keeps society stable. And then after the 1960s?
Collier: It was sort of what gives some groups power and others not having any
power in society. So classically for people trained in the 1950s--and I was
trained in the late 1950s as an undergraduate--it was structural functionalism
basically. Then came all of the Vietnam War and all of the conflict stuff.
The issue then became “How do some groups get power and shape
society?” So that was kind of the real differences.
[00:43:00] Structural functionalism is melded much better with the
biological anthropology. Also because North American anthropology had
very much been founded with biological evolutionary studies and cultural
studies going along together. But of course the political view, the conflict
view of how power is differentiated often conflicted a whole lot with
evolutionary notions about “it’s in our genes” and things. Because often the
kind of power that they saw in people’s genes was not the kind of power
that one wanted, i.e. racist and sexist. [Laughter] If you were a cultural
anthropologist, you wanted to think about other kinds of power, not as
something inherent in one’s genes but as something that [was inherent] in
social processes that gave some people power and deprived others of it.
Asfaha: [00:44:11] And so following this split, you went ahead and did more field
work, right?
Collier: Yes. We escaped some of the conflict by applying for grants and going and
doing more field work, yes, getting out after the split. Yes.

109

Asfaha: Then you came to the decision of early retirement with George in 1999,
right?
Collier: Yes.
Asfaha: How did you come to that decision?
Collier: We had always intended to retire early. My father retired early. He thought
he had heart trouble--I think he was 55 or so. And so he retired, and his
heart cleared up immediately. But then he had twenty years of being able to
travel and do things he wanted to do, and he’s had a wonderful time.
Basically we had always intended to retire early so we could have fun. And it
is true that being a professor, as you hopefully will find out some day, is a
24/7 job. You are always working and you always have responsibilities, and
particularly you have lots of responsibilities to students and colleagues and
things that are moral responsibilities rather than so much day-to-day official
things you have to do. You live in a web of obligations.
[00:45:54] So we had always intended to retire early and the tensions
in the department and the miseries around that convinced us to go ahead.
Also, for me anyway, the kind of anthropology that I loved was going out of
fashion. So I was just as happy to let other young people come along and do
their thing. Because my experience had been, again, as a child of the sixties,
I had a whole lot of criticisms and things to say about the earlier
anthropologists who had been working under the paradigms of the 1950s
and so on. So I remember a whole lot of criticizing and stuff. Younger
people were coming along and criticizing me. I thought, “Hey, they deserve
their chance.” [Laughter] And then as I say, the kind of anthropology that I

110

loved, which was partly some of that 1950s stuff, was trying to understand
the world in which other people live, trying to realize that there are very
different kinds of worlds, and how do you think yourself into somebody
else’s world.
[00:47:15] Whereas by the time we retired, there was a lot of
pushback against that kind of view. Because, of course, lots of the “primitive”
societies did not want to be seen as primitive. And obviously you had people
wanting to not be treated as exotic and different from Western Civilization.
They wanted to be treated as civilized and so on. So the kind of stuff I loved,
which was really trying to realize that other people really did live in worlds
that were different from ours, was coming under a lot of attack--for very good
reasons. And so I thought, “Hey, I’m going to do other things.”
Asfaha: [00:48:00] Absolutely. And so you talked a little bit about the commitment
that it was to be a Stanford professor and to be a scholar and the
responsibility that you felt to your colleagues, perhaps the field, and your
students.
Collier: Yes.
Asfaha: In the year 2000 you received a service award from the graduate student
program and board and the office of the dean of students. I think that’s
such an exciting, exciting thing to receive and to be recognized for. Do you
think of yourself as having really helped shift or expand the field? How do
you understand yourself in relationship to Stanford’s history and the
Anthropology Department in particular?

111

Collier: [00:49:00] I’m not sure so much as to Stanford history, but we had fabulous
graduate students in the 1990s. And a lot of the pain of that split was trying
to protect our students, help our students through really very trying times.
As I say, we had really fabulous students, a lot of whom we still keep a lot of
contact with.
Asfaha: So you said to protect your students during trying times. During the
nineties?
Collier: Yes, when there were all those conflicts in the Anthropology Department,
to try to not get them caught up in it. Because they obviously had to have
advisors and so on. And trying to sort of see them through when all their
faculty was fighting with one another. It was horrible.
[00:50:00] But Joe Greenberg I’ve talked about, who was with me on
the Mosher case, he retired and he for years and years and years had taught
the basic incoming graduate student course, the History of Anthropological
Theory. So I took that over and I loved that. Actually it had been a group of
students who put together a course, because just like Western Civ turned
into “Culture, Ideas, and Values,” the “History of Anthropological Theory”
[changed]. How would I describe that change? Oh yes, they wanted not just
the history of Anglo-American anthropology, but to add sort of French
anthropology and other anthropologies.
[00:51:00] So that was really fun. I inherited that course and taught it
for years and years and years. So I got, I think, the graduate students in that
course and got a lot of very good people who then worked with me out of
that course. So the award didn’t actually mean that much to me, I’m afraid.

112

But the chance to work with these fabulous students really meant an
enormous amount to me and continues to do so.
Asfaha: Did you have perhaps a favorite part about being a professor? You have
done the field work for so many years, but I imagine being a professor it
was just so different, that sort of three parts of doing the teaching, of doing
the research, and also the advising.
Collier: [00:51:55] Yes. The part of teaching that I really enjoyed most was teaching
graduate students obviously, working with graduate students. At the end a
lot of it was even collaboration with graduate students. I collaborated with
graduate students on articles and things like that. So that was probably the
most deeply-rewarding to me. Once I figured out teaching, I really enjoyed
it. Because having to organize things to be able to present them to
somebody else helped me figure them out. Also I really enjoyed the writing-the research and the writing. Again, because I am the kind of person who
likes to organize things. So I loved putting arguments in order and
organizing things, both in writing and in teaching and in all the rest of it.
[00:53:00] One of the things that happened in anthropology was the
idea of organizing everything and putting nice pictures and arguments got
challenged by postmodernism which said, ”No, no, the world is fragments.”
[Laughter]. So again, that was one of the things that said, “Well, the things I
love and the kind of work I do best is no longer in fashion. It’s time to let
other people take over.”
Asfaha: Oh wow, that’s just great. Thinking about life after Stanford, looking back,
how do you compare the attitudes of women and men in your courses and

113

how that has changed over time? Maybe your experience up at the front of
the table, the Socratic seminar or the classroom felt different for you? Did it
feel different for you from the beginning of your teaching career towards
the end?
Collier: [00:54:03] Not that I recall, no. Anthropology has always been a field that
was welcoming to women, even though they weren’t on the tenure line. And
so when women did come in, it was very welcoming. A lot of our students
have always been women. I guess I was really fortunate in that I personally
never felt really discriminated against. I always felt grateful for having a
chance. I knew that had I been male I would have probably had more
chances and this and that. But hey, I was very grateful for the opportunities
that I had. I mean there were always some men students, like Steven
Mosher, who would have nothing to do with women and looked down on
us. [00:55:03] There are always some men who look down on women. But
basically no, I was treated pretty well and got along very well with male
students and female ones, yes. So I don’t recall any major changes.
Asfaha: Okay, well, I think that’s a lovely place to stop.
Collier: Okay, thank you.
