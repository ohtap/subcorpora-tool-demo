SOHP INTERVIEW WITH FHYLLES CRAIG
NOVEMBER 18, 1986

Webb:

^

This is Mimi Webb. It's November 18, 1986, and I'm
interviewing Phyllis Craig. Phyllis, you were born in long
Island, New York, in 1918. What was it like to be a child in
your family at that time?

Craig:

I was the youngest, and I imagine I was spoiled. My
mother was a very anxious person, so she, I think, made me quite
anxious. I remember very, very little of my childhood, and
there are, I'm sure, reasons for this, because it was not a
happy childhood, and I think I've blocked it out. I remember
certain instances of my childhood, but I suspect that a good
deal of this comes from photographs. I remember, for instance,
being terrified because I was put out in one of the
old-fashioned wicker carriages—not the pram, but a
carriage—all bundled up in a fur blanket of some kind or other,
a fur cover, and left alone outside. I know there's a picture
of this someplace, and I think this has triggered it in my
head. But I was absolutely terrified of the furnace man,
because we all had furnace men in those days. I had many fears;

2

that was one of them, which was recalled by the picture, I am
sure. I was also terrified of dogs barking at night, scared of
the dark, and I suspect that I didn't have much comfort for
these things, because I continued to be afraid of many things
most of my life. So [Remainder of Side A is blank. ]
Webb:

[Picking up from end of Side A] —to the time that you
graduated from the Shipley[?] School, what did you do after
graduation?

Craig:

First thing I did was to go back to the dude ranch, where
I had been (laughs) the year before in Montana. Again, a very
close friend of mine at school, who's still a very close friend,
and I went to the dude ranch for two months in our junior year
and again at the end of our senior year in school. This was a
great time, absolutely marvelous, and this is where I found that
I really enjoyed the wide-open spaces and could get along with
people quite different from the ones I'd been in school with,
except that it was a very expensive dude ranch, and so there
were rich people there. But the ranch hands and people like
that I really enjoyed. So that was the first thing I did.

Webb:

New, most of your friends were expected to go on to
college after graduation—

Craig:

All of them were expected to, yes.

Webb:

—and you were expected to go on to college, too.

Craig:

Right. But, because of the really poor parenting that I
had had, my academic skills plummeted around about teen age. My
mother and father were divorced when I was fifteen, but before
that, really, when I was about thirteen or so, this very bright

child that I had been suddenly was no longer bright. So I
really had to struggle a great deal in school and would not have
been able to pass the college boards. I knew that, and the
teachers knew that, and ncbody ever tried to helproewith this
at all. They just figured that I wasn't going to pass, and so I
didn't even take the college boards, although I took the college
course. So then I realized that I really had to light out on my
own and do something that was worthwhile, but, again, I fell
into it, because my sister had worked in this school for a year,
also.
Which school was this?
This was the Mequan[?] School, you see, where I went to
work. She had worked with Dorothy McFarland[?], who was the
woman who was the director of the nursery school, who was a
friend of my father's and, again, somebody that I looked up to a
great deal. She and her husband lived quite separately in the
same house. This was a situation which interested me and which
was vaguely familiar to me. She had her apartment and he had
his, and, whenever I wanted to stay there, I had my room, so
that I could stay there when I didn't want to go home. So she
watched out for me in that year, in Mequan[?], and saw to it
that I always had a place to go to.
Describe the job.
This was simply a nursery school job. These were
children, again, from very rich families, many of them
divorced. The children were brought in the morning by
anybody—by the mother, the father, the maid or whoever. I

4

don't think that any of them stayed all day—it was sort of
before the day care center for the rich came into being. But I
learned about these parents, again, the kind of people that they
were—these were old Ehiladelphians, many of them, Curtis Bok
being one of them—so this was an eye opener to me in a way,
just to see that there were lots of broken families, and that
any kind of a nursery school or elementary school where people
really cared about the children was good.
There was an English couple there teaching, who were
excellent. They were beautiful teachers, for one thing, and
they tried very, very hard to get me to go to Black Mountain
College. I don't knew whether you knew that or not, but, again,
this was a progressive school that I was teaching in, and Black
Mountain was the nearest thing to a progressive college that
there was, certainly not a traditional college. But I couldn't
take that yet, and I never applied. Hard as they tried to get
me to, I didn't do it.
Webb:

You were very resistant to the idea of going to college.

Craig:

Very. Going to do anything else where I had to sit in the
classroom ever. So the director, I guess he was called, of the
Mequan[?] School had been a teacher for a long time, and he took
it upon himself, again, to give me things to read, and he would
take me off, maybe once every week or so, and go through the
stuff that I had read and the stuff that I was doing and in this
way just to give me a little more insight into what it was I was
supposed to be doing, and into teaching.

Webb:

So it was like a tutorial for you, then.

5

Craig:

Yeah. Umhm. So I felt I learned, again, a great deal
there, which stood me in good stead.

Webb:

Do you feel that you achieved a greater understanding of
your own family situation because of working with these children
in this particular school?

Craig:

Umhm. And also in the contacts with Dorothy McFarland and
her home situation. I was learning all the time about different
ways that families live.

Webb:

It sounds as if you were very receptive, because you
needed understanding, you needed to understand your own
situation.

Craig:

Umhm. It was in many ways a difficult time. I had to
drive all the from Westchester, Pennsylvania, which is way
outside of the mainline, even—it was about an hour and a half
away. The first year I was teaching there, my sister went to
Bryn Mawr College, so we were able to drive together. The
second year, she had quit. I had to drive myself, and I really
wasn't—well, I hadn't done a great deal of driving, but it was
a very hazardous drive, in the winter particularly. The winters
then were very, very severe, and I had to, all by myself
(laughs), take this car and drive all of this hour and a half,
or whatever it was, to get to work, and that was why, often when
the weather was so bad, I simply stayed with Dorothy McFarland
instead of going home.

Webb:

So do you feel that you could trace the roots of your
interest in child care to this experience?

Craig:

Yes, certainly. But probably more to the London

6

experience, because that was when I learned that I had the
ability to work with atypical people and children.
Webb:

All right. New, since we've skipped backwards, let's skip
ahead now, back to Gordon. So you returned to the U.S. engaged,
and in the meantime you had broken up with a young man in
Pennsylvania.

Craig:

Yeah. (Laughs.)

Webb:

Did he know about this

Craig:

Who, Gordon?

Webb:

No, your—

Craig:

Oh, the other one? (Laughs.)

Webb:

—•

?

friend in Pennsylvania, did he know about it

before you came home?
Craig:

He was fearful, he was fearful, as soon as he knew that I
was going to live away and in London. He still had hopes, but
he decided that that was probably the end.

Webb:

So when you came back to Pennsylvania—let's pick up on
your life there. What happened?

Craig:

Well, first of all, we had intended to be married then,
and Gordon was going to take a job at some ridiculous pay, like
$800 a month, or something, at Indiana or Illinois or one of
those places, and we were just going to live however we could.
But then, he got an offer of a fellowship in the graduate school
at Princeton, but he had to be a bachelor to accept. (Laughs.)
So, it was so much more money, and he needed this time, because
he was working on his Ph.D., so we didn't get married. So then
he was in Princeton, and I then went to live, for the first time

7

in many years, with my mother.
Webb:

Where was that?

Craig:

Well, she had an apartment in the Barclay[?] Hotel in
Bittenhouse[?] Square in Philadelphia. She furnished iry roam
with very pretty things, antiques—she was a great antique
collector. Some of the things I still have. That was a trial
in itself, but we survived. I spent weekends either in
Princeton or back with my father, who, by this time, had
remarried and lived in still another town, Malvern[?],
Pennsylvania. That year, then, I taught in a nursery school in
the University of Pennsylvania Hospital, on Thirtieth Street.
This was a nursery school for normal children, except that,
because it was in the mental health unit of the hospital, we did
occasionally get some borderline children. I didn't pay an
awful lot of attention, I think—that school didn't mean that
much to me. It meant a lot to me to be in the unit where my
mother was also being treated—her psychiatrist was in that
unit. Not that I ever had any connection with him, really, but
it was just kind of interesting to be working in that hospital.

Webb:

So Gordon was in Princeton, and how long was he there as a
Fh.D. student?

Craig:

Just the one year. And then we were married at the end of
that, because his fellowship—this nice fellowship—only lasted
for the one year.

Webb:

Did he get his Fh.D. in one year?

Craig:

Oh, no. No, no. He didn't get that until three or four
years, three years later, I guess.

8

Webb:

So you got married, knowing that Gordon was going to be in
the academic world. And how did you envision life as being the
wife of someone who was going to be a

Craig:

Ji/^t^fji^^-tn

?

Well, I don't think I did envision it at all, because I
had no image to know what it was I was getting into. He got a
very good job as an instructor, which they don't even have these
days, at Yale, and so, for the first two years, then, we lived
in New Haven and made a lot of friends there, also. I did not
have a jcb. He worked hard not only teaching but then also on
his doctorate, and I did his typing. The war, you see, then was
coming on us, because this was in '40 and '41, you see, 1939 and
'40. And then, Yale made the mistake of dropping not only him
from the faculty but a couple of other very—since became very
famous professors. He then was offered a job at Princton and
took it. We, by that time, had had our first child. The war
had something to do with this, too. We were concerned—I guess
we were all concerned—wondering what would happen to us and the
families and whatever. So we decided to have a child, and did,
and she was born in New Haven in May, and we left in June.

Webb:

How did World War II affect your life?

Craig:

Oh, in many ways, because Gordon did various things, you
see, throughout the war. When we moved to Princton, we expected
to be there actually indefinitely. But because of the coming of
the war, he accepted a position in the Office of Strategic
Services, and we had to move to Washington. So we were in
Princeton only a year. Then we moved, lived in a little row
house in Arlington, Virginia, with our daughter; again met some

9

of the same friends that we'd had in Oxford, who had also gone
into government work; and also people from Yale were
there^

x^

werajfcheraT^fct^ So we had quite a

circle of friends, and this was, I guess, quite satisfactory for
him. He became an African expert, which is what happened to
people in the war—even though he was a modern European
historian, he was put in the African section. But, he was a
researcher, and he knew what to do, and so he boned up on Africa
and wrote reports on Africa.
Webb:

How would you describe life for yourself in Arlington at
that time?

Craig:

Well, it was different. Arlington was sort of a swamp at
that time, and there was this one row of houses sort of along
the edge of a freeway. We had some good friends from New Haven
who were there, too, fortunately, and they had a boy just a
little bit older than my daughter Susan. We had no car. So it
was different.

Webb:

Did Gordon work normal office hours, or did he have long
hours?

Craig:

No, I think they were pretty normal. He had to take the
train or the bus in—I forget which it was that he took—and the
same out again. We had a fair social life because of all of
these friends that were also working in Washington. So that was
sort of fun.

Webb:

Did you have any concerns that he would be sent off
overseas?

Craig:

Oh, sure. And he never really knew what he was going to

10

do. I guess many of these sort of intellectual types really
didn't know whether they would be kept on in government or would
want to stay on in government. And then, also, in the
universities, you see, they were running training programs. So
that's what Gordon came back to at Princton then.
Webb:

How long was he in Washington?

Craig:

Just a year.

Webb:

One year. And then he went back to Princeton.

Craig:

Then back to Princton, and was involved in officers'
training courses and whatever, where they had to learn history
and had to learn various other things in the humanities and
sciences. So, again, many of our academic friends were involved
this way during sort of the middle years of the war. And then
he decided to became a Marine (laughs), and did. This guy was
all set in his academic career and decided that he wanted to
became a Marine, so he went to Officers' Training School in
Quantico, came out as a captain, and—

Webb:

Where were you during that time?

Craig:

Oh, all over. With him part of the time and became
pregnant again—I can't really remember when who was born—but I
shifted arcund a good deal but was pregnant with our second
daughter when he was shipped overseas. Meanwhile, our first
daughter had contracted mumps, and Gordon was in training, and
gave mumps to our next-door neighbor, who was an enormous macho
flier, who got mumps from our daughter, and that was a very
rough thing (laughs). We didn't hear the end of that for a long
time.

11

Webb:

Were there any lasting consequences?

Craig:

(Laughs heartily.) Well, they had two children, I think,
at the time. Whether they ever wanted any more, I don't know
(laughs), or could have had after this, but they were pretty
angry people, really angry at that, so—

Webb:

How did you handle that?

Craig:

(Laughs.) Well, I was apologetic. What else could I be?
We had a doctor, but mumps can do funny things, and the doctor
wasn't all that certain that she had mumps. So, I guess we took
normal precautions, but not extranormal precautions, because we
weren't really sure she had mumps. We found out that she had
mumps when I got them, when I was pregnant, anyway. But we had
moved away by that time and gone to stay with same friends in
New Haven just prior to Gordon's departure. These, again, were
very good friends—this was a Princeton classmate and our
daughter Susan's godfather—so they knew that this was going to
be a hard thing for me, being pregnant and whatever, so they
took very good care of us when Gordon took off for the South
Pacific.

Webb:

So, you were being a wife and a mother during these war
years. And how long was Gordon in the South Pacific?

Craig:

Well, only, again, about a year. And he never saw any
action, because of his intelligence position. He was sent in to
look over places and to make reports and whatever, but he never
did see any action, fortunately. He did a lot of traveling
around the islands, but he was in Honolulu when the war ended.

Webb:

When he came back after the war, he returned to Princton

12

as a faculty member?
Craig:

Returned to Princton, umhm, as an assistant professor by
that time.

Webb:

And was that something that you welcomed?

Craig:

Sure. I'd been—

Webb:

Did you like your life at Princton?

Craig:

Yes, I did. I liked it very much. And we'd by that time,
then, had two-and-a-half-children (laughs), and so my concern
was always where we were going to live. Gordon, looking over
his diary today when I got home from work, was astonished to
find that, in his accounts of those years, he never said where
we were living. And I realized then that it didn't matter to
him where we were. It mattered a great deal to me but not to
him. And we moved several times, right within Princton, in
faculty housing.

Webb:

What did you think was expected of you as a faculty wife
at Princeton?

Craig:

Well, our first year there was when things were very
formal. That was when we first moved down from New Haven, when
we were supposed to put on white gloves and take our calling
cards, two from our husband's and one of ours, and go and call
on the older faculty women. And they were supposed to do the
same first to us. They would come, and we were supposed to have
the card tray, and they were going to leave the card there. And
then we had to return these calls. Well, it was that year when
it fortunately was brought home to these women that this wasn't
going to wash, that we were not going to be the kinds of wives

13

any more who were going to be willing to lead that kind of
completely organized social lives.
Webb:

What happened to change that?

Craig:

The war. People were coming and going a great deal, and—

Webb:

The war disrupted—

Craig:

Oh, yes. It really simply flattened this whole, very
rigid, social scheme at Princeton. And whether this happened in
other places, I don't know. But it was interesting that it
seemed to happen so quickly, 'cause there was none of that by
the time we got permanently back to Princeton.

Webb:

So, after the war, then, you felt that no one expected
anything of you as a faculty wife.

Craig:

That's right. We did certainly our share of entertaining,
as everybody did, and there was a lot more of it then than there
is now amongst faculty people.

Webb:

What kind of entertaining?

Craig:

Well, dinners, but—

Webb:

Dinner parties for other faculty?

Craig:

Dinner parties. Yeah. Umhm. Almost entirely faculty. I
had other friends, friends other than faculty, because I had
their children in a group. But wives were not expected to work
at all, and I guess it didn't occur to them. Princeton was a
very small town at that time, and there really weren't jobs for
people. Everybody's kids went to the public schools, and the
mothers took care of the kids.

Webb:

Now you started a play group in Princeton. Why did you
happen to do that?

14

Craig:

Well, I'd been away from any kind of work for a long
time. We lived on the third floor in a big house—it was our
doctor's house—and I felt that Susan needed friends to play
with, and I was pregnant, and I thought I'd try it. And it
worked. So I had about five kids, non-university children, and
I don? 't even remember hew I got them, where they came from.
Maybe I put an ad in the paper—I think I probably did. We
built a sandbox and a swing, down the three flights of stairs,
and I would take the kids down there. But these, again, have
remained friends, these people, these non-university people.
And that was fun.

Webb:

So you started, then, as a way to get playmates for your
own daughter, and then later you formed a cooperative nursery
school.

Craig:

Urrihm. For the third daughter. (Laughs.)

Webb:

For the third daughter. All right. How did you happen to
get involved with the formation of the nursery school?

Craig:

A little bit out of envy. We lived, at that time, in
College Road in Princeton, which is a long row of attached
faculty apartment houses, and my children's best friends lived
about five doors down—girls the same age as my three girls.
And their mother had decided that she would start a co-op
nursery school in one of the town-owned buildings. It could
only take—oh, I don't know—twelve children, or something like
that. It was a thing that didn't interest me at the time.
Nobody knew anything about the education of young children, in
this group. It was a social sort of thing. And I decided we

15

needed more than that—that we needed a real school, a real
nursery school. So I decided not to go in with them—I don't
even knew that they wanted me in. I decided to start my own and
do it for the university, not for the town, because I felt that
was where it was necessary, for us to get going in the
university. So I did, and I think we opened our doors at
virtually the same time, these two schools. (Laughs.)
Webb:

You approached the university for support, and what was
their response?

Craig:

Well, I approached the University Leauge, which was the
faculty women's group. Harold Dodds was president then, and his
wife Marjorie was the sort of titular head of the University
League, I guess, and they jumped at it, they thought this was a
great idea. They couldn't really understand what it was all
about or how it would happen, but there just must have been . .
. I had some other good friends also on the board of the
University League, and I guess I was on the board myself by that
time. Nobody was interested in doing anything about it, but
they just thought it was a good idea. So they went to Harold
Dodds and to the dean of the faculty and put it to them. And
for whatever reason—I do not know—they agreed to give me some
money, provided I could find a place to have this, which, you
know, wasn't easy, even in Princeton. So I did find a place.
It was a big, big old house that had been turned into—the
downstairs of which had been a kindergarten, and those people
were moving, and so we were able to get the downstairs—there
was a whole first floor-f-and the

16

playground
Webb:

~7

You make it sound as though it was easy to convince them
to do this for you.

Craig:

Well, I think it must have been. And, as I say, I'm not
really sure, except that I had good friends. I don't think that
anybody had ever thought of doing this, so it couldn't have been
in their minds. They knew, first of all, that I'd had
experience with nursery schools, and they must have recognized
that this could be a good thing for Princeton.

Webb:

Well, it seems as though you must have the facility to get
people to collaborate with you—

Craig:

I guess.

Webb:

—because it's really a success story that you were able
to get this building at Princeton, and then it was a cooperative
thing, so parents helped, right?

Craig:

Oh, yes. The money that we got from the University League
went into renovating the downstairs. There was really a good
deal—a lot of painting that had to be done and a lot of things
and the bathrooms had to be cleaned up and then there had to be
playground structures built outside. How I did it on that
amount of money, I don't know. But the parents really did pitch
in. Once it was known that there was going to be a place for
these children to go, the faculty children, then they worked—

Webb:

Someone always has to spearhead the idea and enlist
support* . a ^ x n _

Craig:

Well, there was just a very good bunch of parents. And,
again, I think the mothers were probably looking for something

17

to do. The war had somewhat upset their lives, too, and they'd
all come back, and it was something they could get their teeth
into, that made some sense.
Phyllis, what was your role over the next years at the

Webb:

nursery school in Princeton; after you founded the nursery
school, what was your role?
Craig:

Director. Teacher-director, 'cause I, first of all
taught the four-year-old group. It was a half-time job, so
called. My own children needed attention, too, and so did—that
school ran only in the mornings. This was one of the early
preschools. So I had the four-year-old group, and I also had a
parent board of directors, and I had two other teachers, one for
the three-year-olds and one for—it must have been two for some
groups—we didn't have two-year-olds at the beginning, so I must
have had two teachers for—anyway, there were three of us
teaching for this group of children from ages of three to
four-and-a-half, sort of. And so, my role, really, was as a
teacher and as the director of the school and the one who had to
keep it going and make decisions along with the parent board. I
had to learn how to work with parents, which isn't easy. Some
of them were friends of mine and some of them weren't.
One of the interesting things that I just thought of today
is that, amongst the parents was the first woman in the graduate
school at Princton. They never had had women before, and so
she—

Webb:

You mean, as a faculty person.

Craig:

No, as a graduate student.

18

Webb:

Oh, as a graduate student.

[END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]

[BEGINNING OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]
Webb:

This is Tape 2, Side 1 of the interview with Fhyllis
Craig. Phyllis, can you talk about the time that you were the
director at the cooperative nursery school in Princeton. How
did the program develop over the years?

Craig:

First of all, when we had to move from Libby[?] House, the
first place where we had the school, there was always the fear
that we wouldn't get another place to go. I'm used to this by
this time, but I wasn't then, and I had to spend a lot of time
persuading the administration of Princeton that we had to have
another building and that it had to appropriate to the nursery
school for children.
There was a wonderful man by the name of Colonel Fox, and
I don't know exactly what his position was, but I guess he was
the vice-president for administrative affairs, or something like
that. And he was very sympathetic—he'd never been married, nor
any children, nor anything else, but he was very sympathetic.
(Laughs.) So he finally secured for us a barracks building on
the edge of the campus, which turned out to be absolutely
perfect for a nursery school. But it meant that, all over
again, we had to paint and work on the structure and create a
whole new playground and everything.
So, that's sort of the story of my life, but the school
was going on all the same, while all of this was happening.

19

Also, the parents would go—often they were there with their
children for at least two years, and they became more accustomed
to what their role had to be, not only as board members making
the decisions and setting the policy with me, but also as
participants in the classrooms, which, of course, was part of
their—
Webb:

How did they participate in the classroom?

Craig:

As a teacher's assistant, teacher's aide. And since our
classes were much smaller than most classes these days—they had
only twelve children in them—it meant that we were very—the
two adults working in the class—we were close, and then we
didn't have to lay out curriculum plans and all that sort of
stuff; we could simply talk to each other.

Webb:

Were you teaching in the program?

Craig:

Umhm, yes, I was teaching.

Webb:

You were the director and—

Craig:

—and the teacher, of the four-year-olds, the oldest
group. So, when we went into this new building, I, at that
time, had come to know Kathryn[?] Whiteside Taylor, vftio was a—I
knew her only through phone conversations and the mail system,
but she had been instrumental in setting up co-ops in Oregon and
Washington and California. She had a newsletter that I used to
write for, and one of the projects that I had was a noisy room,
which was sort of intriguing. We had an extra room in this
barracks building, and I turned it into a large-muscle activity
room, which we called the noisy room, and one of our
artist-fathers painted beautiful murals all over the walls. And

20

so that was kind of fun, and I got to be known just in this
newsletter through this noisy room. And I used to get hints on
various things that were happening in publications that were out
from Kathryn[?] Whiteside Taylor. She was the only sort of
nationally known person that I was in contact with.
Then there was also the woman who was—I don't even know
what her title was—right new she would be called the licensing
person in the department of social services or human resources,
but at that time she was the person, at any rate, who had to
license nursery schools and who was responsible for seeing to it
that the teachers were qualified and kept up with their
education.
Webb:
Craig:

This is the state of New Jersey?
This is the state of New Jersey. And she and I became
very good friends. It was she vftio pointed me in the direction
of taking courses at Rutgers and Newark and Trenton, which I did
from time to time, courses on specific things that had to do
with preschool education, like art and music and literature and
administration, this kind of thing.

Webb:

How did these courses affect the evolution of the program
in your school?

Craig:

Well, they made me think a lot about what teachers I was
going to hire, for one thing. And I think they just made the
school certainly a better place, because I knew more about what
I was doing and what the other adults should be doing. It also
resulted in my getting a certificate as a preschool director,
which was very useful later on to me. So, that happened.

21

Then—you know, I get bored rather easily with jobs, I
guess—so I decided that we needed two-year-olds in the school.
So, I started an afternoon group for two-year-olds, after nap
time. It began at 2:30 in the afternoon, or 2:00—I've
forgotten. I had a wonderful group of two-year-olds, and that
was fun. And I still have them. But that was pretty much
unheard of, to have anybody as young as that in any kind of an
organized structure.
Webb:

How did you manage all this?—working and taking care of
your own family—you had three little girls—

Craig:

Well, it wasn't easy, I guess, but it was, in a sense, a
half-time job, that was what it was supposed to be, and whatever
administrative things I needed to do I just did at night.
Again, teaching schedules for professors at that time, I think,
were much different, or maybe it was just because Gordon was
younger and didn't have so many other things to do, but he was
actually able to be home between classes. He might have a
couple of classes one day and not have anything else in the
afternoon, or things like that. So he was able to spell me.

Webb:

He was available to support you.

Craig:

He was available. And I had a wonderful cleaning woman,
who took the bus from Trenton two or three times a week and came
to my house and did the cleaning and took care of whatever
children were sick and couldn't go to school, and that kind of
thing. I had a bevy of teen-agers who would baby-sit. So it
really wasn't too difficult to do.

Webb:

Were you the only faculty wife who had a job?

22

Craig:

One of them—the only other one I can think of at the
moment who had a real job, a much harder job than I had, she was
a psychotherapist, and this was, again, a very difficult
profession in a small town like Princeton. She and I agonized
over this many times, and she finally did set up an office and
did get some clients, but—in a city like Trenton you could do
this, but Princeton was a very close society. They didn't think
they needed a psychotherapist. So that was a hard row to hoe.

Webb:

How do you think the other faculty wives viewed you and
the other woman, who had careers or jobs?

Craig:

Well, the other one did not have children, so that didn't
make quite so much difference. She could do whatever she wanted
to do. I have no idea. I think that, since so many of them had
children in the school, they couldn't really think it was the
wrong thing for me to do. I don't think it inspired anybody
else to go to work, because there weren't any jobs. Princeton
was a little place, and there really were no jobs for them.

Webb:

Now, you received support from the university in the form
of buildings in which to have the school. Did you receive any
other support?

Craig:

No.

Webb:

No. The operation had to pay for itself.

Craig:

Oh, yes.

Webb:

But you did have the building, you did have the space,
free of rent.

Craig:

Umhm. That's right. We had to maintain it, and the
fathers did that.

23

Webb:

Did Gordon have any role in this school?

Craig:

Yes. He never had to work in the classroom, that I can
remember, but our youngest daughter was only in it for one year
before she went to kindergarten, and then it was eleven years
before our son got into it. But he did—he would come—often he
would pitch in on work days, that kind of thing—but the best
thing he did was to come and play his guitar for the children.
(Laughs.) Everybody loved that.

Webb:

(Laughs.) Well, it sounds though he enjoyed it, too.

Craig:

Oh, yes, he did, he enjoyed that part of it, at any rate.
uh huh. But he was very good about staying home and taking care
of the kids if I had to go out.

Webb:

Now, after you had established the school—seven or eight
years or so afterward—you did come to Stanford. Can you tell
us about that?

Craig:

Yes. That was quite a break, a difficult one, for me to
leave the school. I left it in charge of a very good friend of
mine who had been teaching but who certainly was not an
administrator at all, and I did this with some trepidation. But
everything worked out all right, because we happened to have at
that time a very good parent—mother—who pretty well took over
and saw that everything ran well. And I was in correspondence
with her while I was in California. So, we brought—this was an
adventure, there's no question about it, going to—that sort of
was an adventure in those days anyway. We rented the home, the
George Knolls'[?] home. He was a history professor, away for
the summer, and they lived on Foothill in the kind of house we'd

24

never lived in, a real California house, complete with cactus
garden and all this kind of stuff, and—
Webb:

Was this your first trip to California?

Craig:

First trip to California. So—

Webb:

And Gordon was at the Center for the Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences for a year.

Craig:

He was at the Center. Uh huh. For a year. And actually
accomplished a good deal in terms of his own work, his own
writing, and what not, at that time. But, again, it was a very
social year, because there was just that kind of a crowd of
professors there, who liked to dance and liked to sing and liked
to play instruments, and so there was—oh, there were parties
all the time. I can stand only so much of that, and I decided
that I was wasting my time. We had one daughter in high school,
another one in junior high and another one in elementary school,
so they were gone all day. And so I—I don't even remember how
I heard about it, but I volunteered as a teacher, or a teacher's
assistant, in the old Children's Health Council, which was then
on Charming Street, in a little old house on Channing Street,
and got to know Betty Miller, who was the director, and Esther
Clark, who was the founder and a physician. So, I worked there
for I guess really about six months, five or six months,
meanwhile being pregnant.

Wetib:

This is as a volunteer.

Craig:

This is as a volunteer, and very pregnant. BttrtfiHt"^
was

- _.

^

the connections that I made there were very good.

— . So,

25

Webb:

What was it like for your children that year at Stanford?

Craig:

Very different for all of them. The high school daughter
was the—got to—Joan Baez, for instance, was in her class at
Paly High, and they became good friends. It wasn't easy for a
high school person to move just for one year to another high
school. The junior high daughter probably had a good time, but
we were horrified at what went on in the junior high school
system in Palo Alto. There—

Webb:

Now, what year was this?

Craig:

'56 and '57. She went to—it wasn't Jordan, it was the
other one, I forget the name of it now, but—

Webb:

Terman?

Craig:

No, there was still another one.

Webb:

Wilbur.

Craig:

Wilbur, that one. A lot of the parents of her friends
were divorced. There were parties given in these houses without
the parents present. The girls were lathered in make-up. And
it was a kind of life that we didn't know anything about at all
and were very fearful of what was going to became of this
daughter. And I think it shaped her life a good deal.

Webb:

So there was nothing like this at Princeton?

Craig:

No, there was not. And it was just a whole different kind
of life for her and for us. For the high school and for the
elementary school, it was pretty much what we had known from
Princeton, but not the junior high system. We had a different
system in the public schools at Princeton, but there was nothing
like this kind of life, completely free and open life, for these

26

junior high kids.
Webb:

How did you handle that?

Craig:

Probably not very well. I did the best I could to
encourage her to be careful, and she became sort of alienated
from her sisters because her life was so different from theirs.
She went to a lot of parties and wasn't paying much attention to
her studies i ^

„••

31x1 1

really do believe that it did

shape her life. She was the only one of our four children who
couldn't get into Stanford. She was very bright, but she simply
had, in that year had just decided that studying was not for
her. She wanted a good time and was going to be independent,
and we had to be very careful about this. So that was her.
And, as I say, the others just went to school here just the way
they would have gone to school in Princeton.
Webb:

And you got pregnant while you were here?

Craig:

While we were here, and went home—

Webb:

How did that affect your life? (laughs.)

Craig:

(Laughs.) Well, in many ways. I was working with
retarded and neurologically damaged children. I was 39, and how
did I know I was going to have a normal child? I didn't. So I
was fearful in some ways. I tried not to think about this, but
I couldn't really help it, when I looked at so many of these
children who had been born when their mothers were my age and
older. There wasn't, at that time, the mechanism for finding
out whether you have a damaged child or not. So, at any rate,
between being scared of that and wondering what in heaven' s name
I was going to do when I got back to Princeton, that was why I

27

worked—it was really good for me to go to work, and—
Webb:

Therapeutic • w\ /x ^ / .

Craig:

Yeah. Oh, absolutely. To have something to do every day.

Webb:

So when you went back to Princeton, did you resume your
role in the nursery school?

Craig:

Well, Charlie was born on the first of October. We went
back about the first of July, or something lite that, by train,
and if you've ever traveled on the train when you're pregnant,
with a dog and three other children, it's (laughs) something
else. So, I got back into contact with everybody, when I got
back to Princeton—although we may also—we may have gone to New
Hampshire for part of that time; I think we did. We had
summered in New Hampshire for many years, and so I think we
went—actually, we had rented our house in Princeton, so we went
to New Hampshire first. So that was a kind of relaxing time,
and that was nice.

Webb:

Were you anticipating a happy return to Princeton. Were
you relieved that you were going back?

Craig:

Well, I guess we'd never thought that we wouldn't, so
there wasn't any question. We loved California, and Gordon had
various bites on jobs here and there, mostly in Berkeley—

Webb:

But it sounds as though it was also a stressful year for
you.

Craig:

It was, in a way, but, you know, it really wasn't—I don't
think it was as stressful, probably, for us as it was for these
other people. As I said, so many of them got divorced, two of
them committed suicide; so we made out all right in that

28

respect. I was anxious to get back to see what was happening
with the school, and I knew that the person I'd left in charge
was not wanting to continue in charge—she knew that she
couldn't and I knew that she couldn't. So, it was good to get
back. I obviously could not really go to work until after
Charlie was born, in the first of October, but I did shortly
thereafter. And, again, Gordon was able to be home off and on
during the week, so that he could take care of him. Then, he
had older sisters by that time, who could also take very good
care of him. So, we just sort of got back into the old pattern
by going to work.
Webb:

And how long did you continue that?

Craig:

Well, until we moved out here, you see.

Webb:

And did Charlie go to the school, too?

Craig:

Charlie went to the school and thrived on it. Gordon,
meanwhile, had had offers from various other places to work.
The one that caused us the most trouble was in Columbia, which
would have meant a real difference in life between Columbia
University and Princeton, but because of my school, we decided
that, if he were to accept that, we would still live in
Princeton, but we couldn't live in university housing any more.
We would have to find another place to live. And I didn't want
to bring up the kids in New York City. So, he thought long and
hard about that, and we visited, we did all sorts of things.
But in the long run, Princeton topped the offer and kept him,
thank goodness, because I don't think that . . . He would have
loved it, because he's crazy about New York City, but I wouldn't

29

have. So, then, as I say, there were various others, and there
was also, then, this business of from Berkeley, which he really
thought would be the California offer—he thought it would be to
go to Berkeley.
Webb:

So, you were both desirous of returning to California.

Craig:

Well, we didn't know until we got a firm offer from
anywhere. We weren't sitting around saying, gee, I hope we get
an offer to go to California. But we looked back on the year
with great fondness, and I loved, I just loved, the
countryside. And Princeton, again, by that time, was becoming a
bit shoddy, very crowded, and we felt as if we were meeting each
other walking up and down the street. We'd done everything
there was to do in Princeton. And so, we were ready to move,
even though this didn't occur to any of our friends,
apparently. They were happy to live and die in Princeton, but
we really weren't. So„

Webb:

So, how did you happen to come back to Stanford?

Craig:

(laughs.) Well, one Sunday at lunch time, the telephone
rang, and it was Gordon Wright

who was the chairman of the

history department at that time, and he said, how'd you like to
come to Stanford? And Gordon came in and told me, I said,
[makes a whooping sound] "LET'S GO!" So he accepted (laughs)
there on the spot. And, we've never regretted it, obviously.
It didn't seem like such a tremendous upheaval as it would have,
had we not spent the one year here before. And we were really
ready for it.
Webb:

So, you came to Stanford the second time as the wife of a

30

history professor, in the history department. How did you see
your role then?
Craig:

Well, again, you see, I have to separate myself from any
role as a wife, because, as soon as I knew we were coming here,
I wrote to the director of the Children's Health Council saying,
I'm coming, I would like a job. I got a letter back immediately
saying, you got it. And so I was preparing for that. Also, we
had a four-year-old boy, we had a daughter at Swarthmore and
another daughter just graduating from high school. So we had a
lot to think about. I had to come out and buy a house, which I
did by myself, because Gordon couldn't come. And anyway, we
couldn't afford to both of us come, so I came out and bought a
house. And so I saw myself as having to fix up a big house, and
then we had the decision of what the Swarthmore daughter should
do: Should she transfer to Stanford?—which she did. What
should the other daughter do? I mean, there were all of these
things, so I didn't have time to think about vfaat I was going to
do as a Stanford wife. I really didn't.

Webb:

But in the meantime, you were still being director of the
nursery school there.

Craig:

Umhm.

Webb:

Did you think about starting a nursery school at Stanford?

Craig:

No, because I wanted to work at the Health Council. That
was my great ambition at that time—was to get back to the
Health Council and work there.

Webb:

What was there about the Health Council that was so
enticing to you?

31

Craig:

Working with handicapped children. As I say—you know,
there are people who can do this and people who can't, and I had
found out that I could, when I was volunteering, when we were
out here at the Center.

Webb:

Was that more of a challenge to you than the nursery
school?

Craig:

Oh, yes. Oh, you bet. It became more and more of a one
as time went on, but it—you see, I'd been working really on my
own at the nursery school. At the Health Council there were
physicians, there were psychiatrists, there were psychologists,
there were speech therapists, all of these people working with
the same children that I would be working with. That was indeed
a challenge for me, and I knew that I'd learn a lot. I expected
to be just a teacher. I found out when I got here that they
were going to fire the director, whom I had known before, and
put me in her place, which was difficult for her, and a wee bit
for me, too. But she understood; she hadn't had the training
that I had; she had no certificate of her own. So, I didn't
know that Mien we moved out here; I thought I would just be a
teacher. But that soon changed.

Webb:

So you had a job waiting for you. And were there any
surprises in that job when you—

Craig:

Every day, every day.

Webb:

Did you start as soon as you got here?

Craig:

Yes, well, well, as soon as Charlie got—Charlie went to
Bing[?] that year. Gordon's mother came out to live with us,
which helped me a great deal, obviously, and by the time Susan

32

had got—Susan lived at home and went to Stanford—and so I had
the home to think about and how that was going to work out with
all of them. And so, to be perfectly honest, I wasn't paying an
awful lot of attention to how Gordon was getting on. I knew he
was perfectly capable of doing whatever it was he had to do.
And so I wasn't really concerned, as long as I knew his friends,
and we made mutual friends and we did things with them. That
was all, again, that was ever required of a wife.
Webb:

So, when you arrived at the Health Council, did you start
working as soon as you arrived, as soon as you got here?

Craig:

Almost. Well, when the kids got into school.

Webb:

And then you found out that you were going to be the
director almost immediately?

Craig:

Yeah. Iftrjmr. And there were lots of changes taking place
there, too. Structurally, as far as the building was
concerned. And I made many changes in the school when I was
there, just sort of instinctual kinds of changes. But the most
exciting thing was really working with the medical director, who
didn't have the ability to work well with parents, but with
children he was simply superb. And so, more and more I did
things with him, when he was examining children. Then I would
go and be there at the same time. So I learned an awful lot
this way.

Webb:

So you were learning from—were you also—what was the
reason why you went in with him to examine the children?

Craig:

I guess because I wanted to and because I felt that he was
not good in talking to the parents.

33

Webb:

Oh. So, you felt that your role was to be a bridge, then,
between him and the parents.

Craig:

Well, at least to be present, so that I could break into
this kind of dry dialogue that was going on between—well, it
was dry on his part; it wasn't on theirs—they were very anxious
parents, obviously. But I could, from knowing the children, I
could at least clue them in a little bit to what the next years
were going to be like for these children. And I knew about the
public school system here, and who was going to get into it and
who wasn't, and that kind of thing.

Webb:

What kinds of problems did the children at the Health
Council have?

Craig:

You name it, they had it. Some of them were—
theoretically, they were not severely retarded. The C.A.R. [?]
was supposed to be taking care of the severely retarded.
However, we did have some Down's syndrome children. We had more
and more seriously emotionally disturbed children, which was the
way the Clinic was going—getting rid of some of the more
retarded and taking on the more emotionally disturbed, which
eventually was why I left. But, we had children with hearing
difficulties, children with—and the rarest diseases, the names
of which I've now forgotten—but children who had to be handled
very carefully physically, children who didn't grow, children
who were rambunctious, violent, everything. We really had
absolutely everything. And I liked it that way. I hated to see
the retarded go, because we really could work with them. For
the first year, as I was working into being director, I was also

34

a teacher, thank goodness, because it would have been difficult
for me to have been a director.

[END OF INTERVIEW]

1

SOHP INTERVIEW WITH FHYLLJS CRAIG
DECEMBER 9, 1986

Webb:

Alto, on December 9, 1986. This is Mimi Webb
interviewing Phyllis Craig. Fhyllis, hew did you became
involved with the child care program at Stanford?

Craig:

It was mostly due to Dorothea Almond' sj?] persuasion. She
had been instrumental in getting a child care section going in
the Faculty Women's Club, and so she wanted me to come in on
that with her. She had been on the sort of periphery of the
child care movement at Stanford and felt that she needed a
companion in this. So I came along to see what I could do.

Webb:

Because the child care program has already been covered in
campus publications over the years, we don't want to cover old
ground. What's not in the record? What's the unreported side?

Craig:

The unreported side, obviously, is everything that went on
behind the scenes. It was declared in the child care policy,
the Leifer[?] Report, that child care was to be under the Dean
of Student Affairs' office, so that is where we had to begin in
order to became really involved in finding a place for the
Children's Center and getting it going.
In order to work with the Dean of Students, who was Jim
Lyons[?] and still is, I was introduced to Dan Williams, who was
at that time the Associate Dean of Student Affairs. He has
since left Stanford and gone to Oregon, I believe. But any
rate, he had an office in Tressider. He was not only the
Associate Dean of Student Affairs; he was also the director of

2

Tressider Union? and he and I did a great deal of talking about
how I oould work in as either a director, or as at least a
counselor and advisor to the Children's Center. So, for quite
some while, we just talked about what to do. I didn't have an
official position, I didn't have an office, but I worked with
him on various things that needed to be done.
And then, shortly after that, in 1973, as it has been
reported, I did go to the Children's Center as the director of
the program, half time, and the other half time I worked with
Dan and with the university on smoothing things out and really
figuring out what a children's center had to be, how the parents
should be worked into it. This was already a co-op, but the
parents really weren't organized in such a way that they really
knew what they were doing, in terms of a Board of Directors,
which every co-op must have.
Webb:

How would you describe the response of the university
administration when they were approached to formulate a child
care policy and subsidize the program?

Craig:

They never have subsidized a program, for one thing. We
had hoped, of course, that they would. Their response was good
except as far subsidizing a center would go. This was not part
of the policy, and we were sorry to find that the administration
did adopt a middle-of-the-road policy, which was not to
subsidize child care. They eventually were willing to give us a
building, and they always have, through various acts that were
entered into, but they were dead set against contributing any
money to child care. And we've lived with that ever since.

3

The response as far as women in the university was
interesting because we became very friendly with, fortunately,
Ann Minor[?], who was the—now, what was it called?—she had the
position of—she was the women's advocate, but that wasn't the
name of her position. She had an office, and she was working
virtually full time on the dean's staff to see to women's
affairs, women's rights, child care being, obviously, intimately
concerned with women's rights. So she was a big help in terms
of a liason office with the university. And she and I worked
quite closely together when matters came up of how women,
particularly these co-oping women, could be employed at
Stanford, or be full-time students at Stanford, and still be
co-oping parents in the Children's Center. But it was felt by
the Dean of Students then, and still is, that this was something
that was absolutely essential if Stanford was to have child
care. It was going to have to be a parent subject, and they
were going to have to participate.
Webb:

Sometimes one gets help from unexpected sources. Did that
ever happen?

Craig:

I don't think so, unless possibly with Bill Miller, who
was the provost at the time . His wife was very active, again,
in women's affairs. Although he wasn't a likely person to be an
advocate for us, he turned out to be one. He turned out to be
very fair; and having a friend in the provost was an enormous
help, particularly since the president was not all that friendly
to child care.

Webb:

What did Bill Miller do for you?

4

Craig:

Talked to me. He agreed to listen to some of the problems
that we had, for instance, with the building, because that old
elementary school was in very poor shape, and just in listening
to the needs of the families with child care and in not cutting
us off, I think we just felt as if he was somebody we could
always count on at least to go along with us if he felt we were
being reasonable. And so we tried to be reasonable.

Webb:

Who was the president at that time?

Craig:

Dick Lyman was the president, and Jing Lyman, his wife, of
course, also was very interested in women's affairs and in
making sure that women were able to work and to study and to
have a place for their children. But she wasn't active herself
in anything, really, that we did for child care. She listened
to us, too, but she wasn't—I don't know whether she felt she
simply had too much to do, and that's quite possible. But she
really was not personally involved in any of the child care
negotiations going on.

Webb:

What sort of response did you have from Dick Lyman?

Craig:

Only that he felt we always wanted too much, and he was
the one who coined the phrase for me, for instance, as somebody
who wanted everything from the cradle to the grave, and he was a
little (laughs) sarcastic about it, I guess. I think he just
did not want to became too involved himself. He felt there were
other people in the university who could be, and although we
were very good friends, have been all along, and he had been a
student of my husband's and whatever, nevertheless, whenever we
got together, there was sort of a sidelong glance, as much as to

5

say, there she goes again, that kind of thing.
Webb:

How have the administrations changed over the years, their
attitudes toward child care?

Craig:

Well, I really—because we're under the Dean of Student
Affairs, and since Jim Lyons[?] has been the dean ever since
I've been in this, we've had very little to do with any of the
other administrators. Provost, yes, when we had to move the
Children's Center and had to have the funding for that. We had
to get the permission and the agreement of the provost—the
provost's office—to get the funds. But, again, this was done
through the Dean of Student Affairs, and so I had very little
contact with anybody except the people in that office, and they
were the ones who were able to implement the policy so that when
a housing unit was built—faculty housing unit was built—and
this turned out to be—I'm not remembering anything today—the
Senior Citizen Housing

Webb:

Pierce-Mitchell [ ? ].

Craig:

Pierce-Mitchell. That was the first time that we were
—

.

able to get money for child care, but it was strictly for the
building of the new center, not for any running expenses, ever.
But our relationships with the Dean of Student Affairs' office
have always been very good.
Webb:

Phyllis, you've already referred to your contact with Dick
and Jing Lyman and their ideas about the child care policy. How
would you describe your contacts with the other presidents and
their wives, Sterling, the Pitzers[?], the Kennedys?

Craig:

I don't think that Wally Sterling really knew much about

6

what was going on; certainly notranchwas at the time that he
was president. Ann[?j Sterling herself believed that women
belonged in the home, mothers certainly belonged in the home.
They should be looking after their own children. And so she had
no sympathy whatsoever with any movement that would enable the
mothers to get out of the home and have somebody else,
therefore, looking after their children. She was agreeable to
having somebody come into the home and look after the children,
but not to having children in a center. So that—we were always
friendly there, too, but she made it very, very clear she was
never going to do anything to help us.
The Kennedys now—I really shouldn't say the Kennedys,
because we have rarely had any contact with Don himself except
on committees—but Jean Kennedy, his wife, has been enormously
interested and very helpful in all of my plans for the new
Center, which we hope will be in operation in another eighteen
months. Because of her position in the Hospital and because
this Center will have the kind of schedules that will enable
Hospital and Medical Center people to have their children in at
odd hours—early morning, late night, possibly weekends—this is
her great interest, in seeing to it that hospital employees will
be able to take advantage of this Center. So, her husband
certainly has not opposed her, but he hasn't shown any actual
support, except possibly supporting her, I don't know.
Webb:

Did you have any contact with the Pitzers[?]?

Craig:

I don't remember any contact with the Pitzers at all,
absolutely none, and so therefore I don't—there just must not

7

have been any, it just wasn't something that they got involved
in.
Webb:

Do you know how the Stanford child care policy compares to
the child care policy at other universities?

Craig:

Yes, although I don't know that they necessarily have the
kind of written-down policy that we have, which was, after all,
a graduate student piece of work. Most other universities do
subsidize in some way or other their child care programs. Now,
although Stanford does not subsidize us, they do give us the
buildings, which, of course, is a tremendous contribution.
But child care varies a great deal from university to
university, and in the association to which we belong, most of
the other members are state universities, and they, therefore,
are supporting financially the children's centers. They also
have students working in the centers, or at least giving their
time for credit, because they have programs for early childhood
education, which Stanford does not have.
So there—of the few private universities that have joined
the Coalition for Campus Child Care, which we joined several
years ago, have different ways of supporting child care. Often
one center will be a child development center, which is the sort
of thing that Bing^] is in a way, here at Stanford; that is to
say, it is the lab center for the Department of Education or the
Department of Psychology, as the case may be. Or it will be in
Home Economics, maybe in a state university. There are many
ways that other universities can support child care financially
which we cannot do.

8

Webb:

Has the Education Department or the Psychology Department
at Stanford ever became involved or showed an interest in the
child care program?

Craig:

Not nearly as much as we would like. We have tried hard.
DorotheaAlmondt?] and I have tried very hard to iirterest
more people in the university, in the academic part of the
university, in these centers. We've had no luck. This may be
our fault. On the other hand, I can see it in a way, because
Bing[£] has been a part of Stanford for so long, has always been
the lab school for psychology and education. There really is no
way, then, for these departments to give any of their support to
us, or to send their students to our centers. There just aren't
that many students, so that if we do get any, they're
volunteers—the students are. If they're studying something
that has to do with children in day care, or something like
that, they tend to go to East Palo Alto or Mountain View or
Redwood City, not the campus child care programs, which is
disappointing to us.

Webb:

What have been your greatest concerns with the child care
program over the years?

Craig:

(Long pause.) Money, always, because in order to pay the
staffs of the centers adequately, comparable to other jobs that
they might have and adequate for their education, our fees are
high, the children's fees. Therefore, we are not able to serve
as many people, as many university employees, as we would like
to be able to serve. That's one reason, is the cost.
Another reason is that, by decree, again in the Dean of

9

Student Affairs, the centers must be co-ops, and it isn't every
employee who can take the time to co-op. Some departments—and
some schools in the university are better than others in terms
of letting their employees take certain time off in order to do
their co-op hours. The Children's Center tries to have in their
enrollment one-third students, one-third staff and one-third
faculty. In order to keep the one-third students and the
one-third staff, they need a great marry scholarships. And this
is our biggest headache. I don't have the Children's Center
budget with me, but an enormous part of that budget is for
scholarship aid, which, of course, brings up the fees for the
parents who have to supply the money.
Webb:

And how do you generate the money for the scholarships?

Craig:

Well, it's built right into their budget. There's a
certain number thousands of dollars within their budget that
goes for scholarships, and the income is from fees. Now, the
Child Care Resource Center, where Dorothea[?] and I work also
has a scholarship fund, and just today I took our fund-raising
letter down to be printed, and it will go out, as it does every
December, to—it started out simply with friends of ours who we
knew were interested and would give, and gradually our list has
grown through the years. We don't get very much money this way,
but we have some very faithful donors, and each year we get a
little bit more, I guess, than we did the year before.
So, what we do with this scholarship fund, is to match
what the centers give, when this is necessary. But it varies a
great deal from center to center. We've only had requests for

10

scholarship funds from the Children's Center within the last
year, because their budget became so big and they had so many
requests for financial aid that they couldn't handle it all with
their own budget, and they had to come to us. The Nursery
School, on the other hand, never has enough money. They charge
much less Mien they took families, so that each quarter, if they
subsidize to a certain extent—and it's not very much—four
families, we will match what they give to those four families.
And this is true, also, for the Feppertree[?] program. And then
we also—we give now to Bing, also, although their fees are
much, much higher than ours at the Center. They also do
apply—they have very special families that they cannot
support—they apply to the Child Care Resource Center.
There is, at Stanford—all of these Centers form the
Council on Child Care, so that Mien I say, the Child Care
Resource Center sends out a solicitation letter every year, it
is in the name of the Council on Child Care. And we have been
very fortunate this year in getting a grant, which will give
two-to-one contribution, so that, for every $50 that we get in
contributions to our scholarship fund, we will then get $100
from this grant. So we should, then, this year build up a good
fund and not to have to worry so much about where each $50 goes,
and also, whether we can invest on this, I'm not sure. The
Stanford Development Office takes charge of all of this, so that
we're not able, for instance, to go out on our own and invest
any of this money, which is a little difficult, too, because^wecpuldhaye-done^^

11

But we also use any surplus money that we have to buy good
toys and good equipment to lend out to our day care home
providers, and this is very important for them. They are mostly
foreign mothers, and they come over here without much equipment,
and this is a big thing for them to be able to have. So this
was started a couple of years ago. And this has been a very
successful program.
Webb:

Are you able to reveal the source of this grant?

Craig:

Probably not. A friend, obviously, and the same friend
has donated money before for other projects. But I don't think
that she would want her name . . . .

Although I don't knew—if

it's going in the Archives, it's kind of silly not to. I don't
know—it is Dorothea[?] Almond's[?] family's money. Her parents
were very wealthy, and they invested well, and they're dead
several years, so they have left an education fund, which
Dorothea and her husband administer. And it is this fund which
has now—part of this has been given to the Council on Child
Care to—for this matching grant.
I would like to mention in connection with the scholarship
money or money for Child Care Center, the Packard family, the
Lucille and David Packard Foundation, as well as Lucille Packard
herself. When I was at the Health Council, Lucille Packard was
on the Board of Directors, and I imagine she still is. Her
consuming interest is in the health and happiness of children in
this whole area of Santa Clara County, Monterey County.
Whenever I have started a new program or—well, for
instance, when I started the Craig Infant Program, I applied to

12

the Foundation, the Lucille and David Packard Foundation, for
some financial help and received it. The same thing was true
when I started the after-school program. The same thing was
also true, even to a greater extent, when the Children's Center
expanded, increased their capacity, and therefore had to have a
new building. We've never been absolutely sure how much money
came from the Foundation and how much from Mrs. Packard herself,
and it doesn't matter. It's her interest.
So, again, when she and I talked, a year ago last June,
about opening up another center that would—we thought at the
time would be a part of the Medical Center complex, she was
interested enough to discuss this and discuss the funding of
it. When it turned out that this was to be a university center,
and not strictly one for the medical complex, I was a little
concerned, but I think that we will get—I know that we will get
the money anyway. They are making a considerable contribution,
"they" being the Foundation, however it comes through the
Foundation, to the establishment of this new center, and it is
really a remarkable thing, I think, that they have stuck with us
all these years.
Other than that, there have not been any other larcre
contributions. From time to time, one of the centers has
applied to a smaller foundation and gotten a grant for
equipment, or the Children's Center applied to a foundation we
had not heard of before this year, which is the Spunk[?]
Foundation, for teacher education, to enable to teachers to take
time off to go to conferences and classes. And so, we're

13

becoming a little more sophisticated in learning how to apply
for money, but it is very difficult for a small concern at
Stanford to persuade anybody that we're not rich just like all
the rest of Stanford. (Laughs.)
Webb:

Phyllis, you referred to the Craig Infant Program a while
ago. What can you tell us about jit?

Craig:

r^weli? the Children's Center, which, you
know, was the first center, did not take very young infants to
begin with. They require a special setting; they require more
staff; they require different kinds of equipment; we simply
didn't have the money or the facility to take very young babies.
And yet, as the years went on, we had more and more and more
applications for the care of infants from one month on. So, it
seemed to me that we simply had to have a center for babies.
There was no place, there was no building. The Children's
Center by that time had moved to their present location, but
they didn't have a set-up, still, for infants.
So, after much agonizing, we were able to acquire first
one, and then a second, three-bedroom apartment in Escondido
Village. However, every apartment in Escondido Village must be
paid for, and when we tried to do this through adding a dime
only to the rent, monthly rent, of each apartment, the students
would not allow us to do that. They were not going to have
their rents raised by that much. So, the program then had to
pay the rent, and this was the first time the Packards came into
this picture. And then, when we acquired the second apartment,
because we had so many babies in one apartment it didn't do,

14

there was that rent as well, and the fees were skyrocketed.
At this time, fortunately, the Children's Center was
contemplating doubling their enrollment and moving, and so they
then were able to arrange an infant unit within their center.
So this had, thanks again, I'm sure, to Dorothea and to the Dean
of Students—when my husband retired in 1979, which was the year
shortly after I had established this Infant Center, I received a
plaque saying that the center was then to be named the Phyllis
H. Craig Infant Center. It was a little bit different then,
because it was Escondido Village, but that's what it had became,
at any rate, and that name has stuck to it in a rather
abbreviated form. It is now called the Craig Infant Program,
CIP—everything has initials. (laughs.)
Webb:

(Laughs.) Phyllis, how did you shift from working
directly with children to your role solely as an administrator
who designs the programs?

Craig:

It was easy. [Clears throat and apologizes.] I had had
children up to here. I had four of my own, and I had been
teaching, really, for a number of years. So, as a teacher, I
was watching what was going on and feeling that these centers
really needed a director (laughs), and my own—you know, I felt
that there was work as an administrator that I wanted to do»

Webb:

Do you ever miss your contact with the children?

Craig:

Heavens, no! (laughs heartily.) I have six
grandchildren. That's enough! (Laughs again.)

Webb:

(Laughs.) What kind of atmosphere did you try to provide

15

in the child care programs?
Professional, primarily, I guess. I think when co-ops
start, they tend to be not very professional, and the nursery
school was done that way, and I was involved in that way back,
too. But I really felt that they needed to be professional.
They must have professional staffs. And, of course, licensing
laws kept changing and becoming more stringent, so that I...
[END OF SIDE A]

Craig:

. . . is a difficult pnfe, with parents being the sole
members of the Board of Directors,, of eases. They can be very
friendly toward the staff one year, and a few people can make
them very unfriendly in another year. And so it has been part
of the job of both Dorothea and me as consultants to try to keep
them friendly, to try to help them over problems that they have
with the staff, with the director, or with the program. It's
not easy, especially when you have as many parents as the
Children's Center has. But it's also been a problem with the
Nursery School with many fewer parents. So, as years go on, we
hope we'll get two consecutive good years, when there isn't a
lot of disruption on the board, and we're lucky if we do.

Webb:

How do you deal with getting cooperation, enlisting
cooperation?

Craig:

Oh, you don't enlist it, you legislate it. The parents in
each case, in the Nursery School and in the Children's Center,
must work X number of hours, depending on how many hours their
children are in the center; that's part of their tuition. They

16

don't have to became members of the board, but every parent must
be a member of a committee, and you just begin, you hope every
year that you'll be able to fill the positions of the Executive
Board. It's really not much fun to be president of a co-op.
You get a lot of flack from parents as well as from staff.
We've been fortunate in that every year there has been one
person who's been willing to be president? and then it's not so
hard, then you do get a vice-president, you do get a treasurer,
this kind of thing. But there are not a lot of parents vying
for positions on the board, ever, and this is a problem, too.
Webb:

Where did you get your ideas for developing child care
programs? How did they evolve over the years?

Craig:

Just from doing it, I think, from having started my own
and having a friend who had started one, from working in other
people's centers, from studying child development, from reading.

Webb:

Have you observed, have you gone to examine other child
care centers?

Craig:

Oh, yes. Many, many, both here and abroad, and should do
more. If I had time, I would like to do more, and, for setting
up the new center, I will have to do more visiting and take
committee members along with me to do it.

Webb:

What kinds of ideas have you gotten from visiting some of
the other centers, that you've been able to apply?

Craig:

Room arrangements, to a certain extent. For instances,
same of us went out to visit a brand new center in a brand new
shopping center in Pleasanton, not long ago. It had only been
open for two weeks. So we were there, able to see brand new

17

rooms, brand new carpeting, brand new equipment, and the whole
thing. I don't know how the program is going to work, but we
were impressed, certainly, with some of the layout of the rooms
and with the equipment. It's good to be able to see a brand new
center. Most of them aren't? most of them are old and tired.
We have some innovations that we want to build into our new
center, so this is what's going to require our visiting, to see
if we can find other centers that have what we think we want.
Webb:

What kind of atmosphere did you try to provide for your
own children?

Craig:

A good home, certainly . . .

Webb:

How do you define that?

Craig:

Well, it's hard to say, because since I was working most
of the time, it wasn't as if I was a stay-at-home mother, but I
firmly believe that it's possible to bring up children and work
at the same time. I worked half-time most of the time, so that
I was there when needed, and my husband was there when needed.
He did a lot of traveling always. One of the nicest things I
think we did for our children was to take them to a little camp
in New Hampshire every summer—this was a little academic
cranmunity—and so they not only were able to know what it's like
to live in a college town, but they also could get' the whole
A

country fram^ew^Haaroasftlre——
Webb:

Do your children share your interest concerning child
care?

Craig:

Not as such. Two of them are teachers, but not in
children's centers. One of them is elementary school teacher,

18

young elementary. She has taught in nursery school, but she
doesn't have the kind of consuming interest that I have.
Another one's a music teacher, which is, again, quite different.
Webb:

As you look at the parents of today's young children, how
do they compare to the parents you dealt with in earlier years?

Craig:

They're much more aggressive. They certainly know what
they want, I think, more than the parents in the earlier years.
The parents, for instance, in icy school in Princeton were not
working. They just wanted something good for their children to
go to. They welcomed time off from not having to care for their
children, but it was not a necesssity as it is now, and that
makes a big difference in the attitude. They weren't feeling
guilty.
So many of our parents now are feeling guilty,
particularly the parents of very young infants, who need
eight-hours-a-day care. And it really does something to them.
So we have to—we certainly sympathize with that? it's difficult
to sit at a desk with a mother of a one-month-old baby, as I had
today, terribly distressed, because she's a professional woman,
in fact, a nursery school director, day care center director,
herself, and she just doesn't know whether she should go back to
work or not. And so . . .

Webb:

How do you counsel her?

Craig:

Well, obviously I can understand her very well, and we
have to tell them what we think are the possiblities for good
child care, and they then have to make up their minds whether
they want to go through with it. But we do try to make them

19

feel comfortable about deciding not to go back to work. And we
would love to have more of them work only part-time. And we do
discuss this with them—is it possible for you to do your job
part-time?
How do you balance the child care program between
educational activity, play activity? What sort of structure is
there? How do you structure it?
Well, of course, it's all educational. Play is
educational. And we don't do what some of the newer schools are
doing now, which is to bear down rather on the children and
start them reading at age two. We do have parents coming to us
saying they want a School, with a capital S, for their
two-and-a-half-year-old. There are some around, and we say, go
if you want to. But it isn't a difficult thing to balance. You
go, really, along with the age group that you're teaching, and
if you have had a good education yourself and you know the age
that you're working with, the balance between education and
play, so called, is right there in front of you, you don't have
to worry about it.
Again, with a parent co-op, if we have parents who are
terribly concerned about what their children learn, we try to
talk with them and explain to them how we believe that children
really are 1 earing. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it
doesn't, and if it doesn't, then they take them out and put them
someplace else.
Child care has been your major pursuit. Do you ever
wonder about another avenue you might have taken?

20

Craig:

No, I don't think so, although I like working with older
people, too, and I keep wondering what I'll do Mien I retire,
whenever that's going to be. And I would like to get back to
volunteering with handicapped people, whether they're adults or
children or teen-agers. I feel that I've neglected this, that I
knew that I can do, and I would like to get back to it. But I
don't think I would want to work with young children again.

Webb:

Why is that?

Craig:

Well, I guess it's siirply because I've had it, and it's
more challenging now for me to think about working with older
children. I did it for a while, at the Neuropsychological
Institute in Princeton, outside of Princeton—worked with
teen-agers there. That was a very brief period, but I loved
it. Did a little bit in London, but never have had the
opportunity. I've been too tied up with this other thing.

Webb:

We haven't talked much about your being a faculty wife at
Stanford. Can you fill us in a little on that?

Craig:

Yes. I probably wasn't as good a faculty wife (laughs) as
a lot of other people I can think of, just because I was always
pursuing my own interests. But, of course, I was a faculty wife
and mother, and Mien we first came here, our eldest daughter
left Swarthmore, where she had been for two years, and was then
a student at Stanford, and so that started my business of being
a Stanford mother. Two of our other children also went to
Stanford.
Because of my husband's interest in Germany and his many
travels, we have been to Germany for a couple of summers with

21

different children, girls being teen-agers and then the much
younger son as a four-year-old in another summer. So, this was
fun, these . . . .

When I said we had taken them to New

Hampshire every summer, we really did, and we still tried to
work in part of New Hampshire, even though we'd also been in
Berlin for part of the time. My husband was the only one who
spoke German, and we were not connected with any Stanford
program when we were there during the summers. This was his own
involvement in the university building.
But then, when we went to Cliveden, in England, for two
quarters, the girls were all off in college, or married, or
whatever, by that time, but our son was twelve, and what to do
about him? To our amazement, some horror, we found that the
public school here couldn't have cared less that he was leaving
for six months. I couldn't even get any kind of a study plan
for him. They gave him a couple of books, and the only thing
they were concerned about (laughs) was math. They wanted to
make sure that we could keep him up with his math, and it wasn't
because he had any interest in it, or that he was poor in it.
It was just that the only thing that they could think of, it
seems to me, that we had to pursue.
So, we did not send him to school. But there were all
these wonderful students who were crazy about him

.

We had a beautiful blonde girl to teach him his math—that was
fun (laughs). He became very close to two of the male students,
and this friendship lasted a long time. He turned thirteen in
that year, and he was a pleasure for them and they were real

22

heroes to him, and this was really a lot of fun. He had a
marvelous time, as we did. We loved England, we loved the
setting at Cliveden, which was out of this world, we did some
traveling. Although I didn't travel with them, my husband did
and Charlie did, our son, when they went—they went to Europe on
a trip, went to Italy—I'm not sure where else they went—I
didn't go for various reasons, so I stayed by myself with one
other man in this en [mechanical interruption].
Charlie was the only one of our children who could be with
us any of the other times when we were in Europe, chiefly in
Germany, so that the last time we were there for the two
quarters, he was able to come over, I guess it must have been in
the summer quarter, and enjoyed being in Berlin very much, as we
all did, I guess. It's a marvelous city. And he traveled
through England with us, too, being our chauffeur, fortunately,
when he was old enough.
But the only time that we were able to take even one other
child, and that was our youngest daughter, was when, on my
husband's seventieth birthday, when there was a big celebration
for him in Munich, as well as—well, the celebration was in
Munich, but we then went on to Berlin—and so Charlie came with
us then, as did our youngest daughter, to celebrate. She had
been on the Florence campus from Stanford and had traveled a
good deal that year and knew something about Germany, and this
was the first chance that she had to get back. So those two
young people had a very good time, as did we, of course. But
they did more things like going out at night to beer halls, and

23

whatever, which we didn't do. So that really was the end of our
traveling with any of our children, and as far as I'm concerned,
that was my last trip to Europe. I've always been working.
Webb:

How would you describe your relationships with the
Stanford students while you were at the overseas campuses?

Craig:

We enjoyed them very, very much. We were more intimately
involved with the ones at Cliveden, because we were living in
the same house with all of them, this enormous Astor estate.
The Berlin campus has only a much smaller house. Very few
students live there, because the idea is for the students to
live with German families. So we had our own apartment, and
although they would come over regularly for classes in the
evening or whatever, we didn't feel that we were as much of a
family as we had felt in England. So, I enjoyed the English
experience, I guess, a little bit more, except that of Berlin.
So, we've kept up with many of these students as the years have
gone on, and my husband hears from them regularlyf and
occasionally I get _

Webb:

Have you had any other trips, any other travel
experiences, that were not associated with the ones you've
already mentioned?

Craig:

Only now, you know, my husband and I have been on a few
trips, but, again, I don't travel well, never have, really, and
since he has to go, at least twice a year, to Germany, he goes
by himself. I have not done much traveling, except what we have
to do, because we have children scattered all over, and so
that's mostly to the East Coast. We took a cruise to Alaska two

24

years ago, which was a real first for us. That's the best
vacation I've ever had inraylife, and I would do it again every
summer (laughs), if I could persuade icy husband to do it with
me. He didn't enjoy it as much as I did.
Webb:

What was so special about it for you?

Craig:

Well, since I don't travel well—I have an intestinal
problem, makes life very difficult for me—but to be in one
place for a week with not having to do anything at all, and to
have this gorgeous scenery just there all the time and to be
able to enjoy it without having to drive a car or pack a bag or
do any of these things that you have to do when you're
traveling—I thought it was heaven. My husband went along with
it, he had a good time, but he didn't think it was heaven.
(Laughs.)

Webb:

(Laughs.) How would you assess your years on campus?

Craig:

Do you mean from one to a hundred, or . . . (laughs
heartily).

Webb:

(Laughs.) Any way you like. Your interpretation.

Craig:

Well, obviously, they've been very satisfactory years,
there's no question about it. My husband has had some quarrels
with some of the things that have gone on with Stanford, as I
have, but he's been so popular, so very much involved, that it's
been very satisfying, certainly, to him, and to me to have him
that way. But we certainly have pursued our own interests.
We have good friends here. We've often questioned whether
it's possible to make such good friends when you move in the
middle of your career, the way we did, because I think, by and

25

large, our best friends are still at Princeton, friends that
we've made, although we have some very good friends and some
very close friends here. We don't see as much of them now, but
this seems to be a trend at Stanford now, or at least what our
friends say, is that there isn't the kind of entertaining that
there vised to be.
When we first came, we made our first friends by joining a
play-reading group, and—I forget even how we got into it—that
was fun. We met month to month, and the host of the evening
chose the play, so we had no idea what we were going to be
reading until we got there. Then, shortly after that, we joined
a discussion group with a lot of very interesting professors in
all departments. There are now twenty-two of us—this has gone
on, this is a group that has actually been going for about
thirty-five years, and we got into it probably in about 1963 or
-4. And, again, the host—we meet on Sunday evenings month to
month—and the host chooses the topic for discussion. We have
psychiatrists, we have psychologists, we have geneticists, we
have physicians, we have English department, you name it.
People have been fairly steady, the crowd has, except that some
of them have had to retire, a couple of them have died, since
we've been in the group. We did get new members in a couple of
years ago. Hank Kaplan was one of the members who did die.
John Dodds' [?] wife also died. John now comes by himself, and
Lee Kaplan comes by herself. I don't know how long it can go
on, how long any of us will last, or whether we will take in new
members if we lost any more. The Paul Hannas[?] have been the

26

only ones who have resigned since we've been in the group, and I
think they thought the other old folks would resign, too, but
nobody followed them (laughs), and so there they were, they were
out, and the rest of them stayed—the rest of us stayed, I
should say. So that has been a great connection all of these
years.
Webb:

How do you like to spend your time when you're not at
work?

Craig:

(Musing) how do I like to spend it? I guess, if I had my
druthers, I would just read things. I recently have been
reading a lot more women's literature, something I never had
done before. I rarely have time to, and when I read, I fall
asleep. I like walking. Actually, even though I don't travel
well, I do like driving around. I love the ocean, I like to go
to the ocean, this kind of thing. It's a little bit easier for
us to do things on the spur of the moment now than it used to
be, since we don't have the big house to take care of any more.
But I find there's no problem with what to do in spare
time, except there just isn't enough of it. But I do try to
keep the evenings free, as I can read the newspaper and look at
some television, if there's anything worth watching. And Gordon
likes to quit his own work, his writing, to watch an hour or so
of something—he needs it to sort of relax. But we try to do
this, or, now that we have a VCR, we try to get a good film, old
film, something like that. We like to go to the movies but
seldom have the time.

Webb:

If you could change places with someone else, who would it

27

be? Did you ever think about that?
Craig:

No.

Webb:

No.

Craig:

I'm ashamed to say, I'm not sure there's anybody that I
know (laughs)—that's an awful thing to say—but I don't really
know who it would be. It would not be a matter of my being
somebody else, but my family would have to be somebody else's,
too, and I don't think I'd like that very much.

Webb:

Is there some subject that you think we haven't covered
adequately? Have we left out anything that you'd like to talk
about?

Craig:

We haven't talked about religion.

Webb:

Would you like to talk about religion?

Craig:

Well, only because there really isn't any, as far as we're
concerned. This is an interesting (laughs) subject, though. We
were all, as a family, very much involved in the First
Presbyterian Church in Princeton. My husband taught Bible
School, I taught Sunday School, the children were all in the
choirs, and we were—this was a great part of our lives.
So, when we came out here, we went to the First
Presbyterian Church in Palo Alto, which was a real eye opener to
us. We had come from this huge, sort of Gothic building
(laughs) in Princeton. First Presbyterian Church in Palo Alto
looks like a motel—you know, it's just a low, redwood
building. So that was the first shock. But, by that time,
people were getting very folksy in the churches, and this was
hard for us to take. We had much more formal experiences in the

28

church. And this has kept us from adopting any kind of a
regular church. And it's stubborness, I dare say, on our part,
but having to turn around and say, "How do you do?" to the
person beside you and go into some long spiel to somebody you
may never see again went against the grain, and the kind of
sermons that we were getting were so much less inspiring and
interesting than the ones we'd had from the great friend of ours
who was our pastor at Princeton. He came up to San Francisco,
was the pastor of the old First Church there, and we did go into
the City occasionally, because that, again, he had the kind of
service that liked, obviously. But that became a chore, going.
So we feel very badly about this and wished that we could
find . . . .

We've hunted around, we've been to various

churches, we cannot find any that we really want to join.
Occasionally we've been to the Chapel, but it's not . . . . The
music is wonderful at the Chapel, of course. The last time we
were there, there was a feeble attempt to get some children to
come up and listen to a children's story. Well, I've had
children's stories, you know, all my life. I really don't want
to hear one in church. And it wasn't done very well; there were
five or six children who were sort of pushed by their parents to
go up and listen to this thing. So, we simply don't go to
church, unless . . . it's very sad.
Webb:

And you haven't found a satisfying substitute activity.

Craig:

No. I tried, years ago—I've tried several things with
this Chapel and with our own pastor—to get a service going in
the middle of the week, on a weekday evening at five o'clock. I

29

think that a lot of us . . . where there would be no frills, no
nothing. There would be a sermon, and there would be a piece of
music, and people could go to it without disrupting their
weekend. We live in California; weekend becomes very important,
and you save up things to do on these gorgeous days on the
weekend, and to go to a church that you don't like takes away
from your relaxation on a Sunday. But I've never got anybody to
go along with me.
Several years ago, our daughter who lives here in Los
Altos asked us if we had made any plans for burial services and
where we were going to be buried, what kind of a service—I
think we had all been to a very lengthy service for one of the
professors here, where the children spoke and various other
people spoke, and I think she sort of panicked a little bit and
wondered what was going to be for Gordon, for instance—she
didn't think about what was going to happen to me, but she
wondered what was going to happen to Gordon—were there going to
be eulogies and all sorts of things like this going on, and
should she knew and the rest of the children know what all this
was going to be. Well, he's not interested in that.
But the question of where people who come from the East
Coast and who have children scattered around are going to be
buried is a real problem for us, and we haven't solved it. And
so, I hit upon a scheme, which we thought was great, partly
because of our German connections, and that is, why didn't
Stanford do what they do in Germany and set aside some of this
vast land that they have for a burial of transplanted faculty

30

and university people? Some of the greatest walks we had in
Germany were in graveyards. There were people whom Gordon
recognized all the time, and this was quite a thing—scholars
come from all over to see the graves of people whom they have
studied and revered. And it seemed like such a wonderful idea
for Stanford.
So, we went to Dave [/?*]" Hammerton[/] KellyJ^] ? he thought
it was a great idea. But that's as far as it ever went. He
could never get anybody in the administration to even consider
it. Mostly, oh, they were concerned about security—how much
money would it cost to keep up something like this, and who
would look after it? So, this comes up every once in a while,
and this worked into Dick Lyman's cradle-to-grave thing «
Xlaughs) , but he

me another-angi

—'

But then, I met another man just a short while ago—he's
the new pastor of the Lutheran church at Stanford, Reverend Mr.
Schmidt[?], and he's a nice kind of a guy, and he has been
around Stanford a good deal, so—I don't know how this came up,
but—I told him of this experience and what little success we'd
had with it. Well, he also thought this was just the best idea,
and he promised to try and peddle it amongst the clergy and the
administration. But I haven't heard any more.

PHYLLIS CRAIG INTERVIEW
TAPE 1
NOVEMBER 18, 1986

Webb:

This is Mimi Webb. It's November 18, 1986, and I'm
interviewing Phyllis Craig. Phyllis, you were born in Long
Island, New York, in 1918. What was it like to be a child in
your family at that time?

Craig:

I was the youngest, and I imagine I was spoiled. My
mother was a very anxious person, so she, I think, made me quite
anxious. I remember very, very little of my childhood, and
there are, I'm sure, reasons for this, because it was not a
happy childhood, and I think I've blocked it out. I remember
certain instances of my childhood, but I suspect that a good
deal of this comes from photographs. I remember, for instance,
being terrified because I was put out in one of the
old-fashioned wicker carriages—not the pram, but a
carriage—all bundled up in a fur blanket of some kind or other,
a fur cover, and left alone outside. I know there's a picture
of this someplace, and I think this has triggered it in my
head. But I was absolutely terrified of the furnace man,
because we all had furnace men in those days. I had many fears;

2

that was one of them, which was recalled by the picture, I am
sure. I was also terrified of dogs barking at night, scared of
the dark, and I suspect that I didn't have much comfort for
these things, because I continued to be afraid of many things
most of my life. So [Remainder of Side A is blank.]
Webb:

[Picking up from end of Side A] —to the time that you
graduated from the Shipley[?] School, what did you do after
graduation?

Craig:

First thing I did was to go back to the dude ranch, where
I had been (laughs) the year before in Montana. Again, a very
close friend of mine at school, who's still a very close friend,
and I went to the dude ranch for two months in our junior year
and again at the end of our senior year in school. This was a
great time, absolutely marvelous, and this is where I found that
I really enjoyed the wide-open spaces and could get along with
people quite different from the ones I'd been in school with,
except that it was a very expensive dude ranch, and so there
were rich people there. But the ranch hands and people like
that I really enjoyed. So that was the first thing I did.

Webb:

Now, most of your friends were expected to go on to
college after graduation—

Craig:

All of them were expected to, yes.

Webb:

—and you were expected to go on to college, too.

Craig:

Right. But, because of the really poor parenting that I
had had, my academic skills plummeted around about teen age. My
mother and father were divorced when I was fifteen, but before
that, really, when I was about thirteen or so, this very bright

3

child that I had been suddenly was no longer bright. So I
really had to struggle a great deal in school and would not have
been able to pass the college boards. I knew that, and the
teachers knew that, and nobody ever tried to help me with this
at all. They just figured that I wasn't going to pass, and so I
didn't even take the college boards, although I took the college
course. So then I realized that I really had to light out on my
own and do something that was worthwhile, but, again, I fell
into it, because my sister had worked in this school for a year,
also.
Webb:

Which school was this?

Craig:

This was the Mequan[?] School, you see, where I went to
work. She had worked with Dorothy McFarland[?], who was the
woman who was the director of the nursery school, who was a
friend of my father's and, again, somebody that I looked up to a
great deal. She and her husband lived quite separately in the
same house. This was a situation which interested me and which
was vaguely familiar to me. She had her apartment and he had
his, and, whenever I wanted to stay there, I had my room, so
that I could stay there when I didn't want to go home. So she
watched out for me in that year, in Mequan[?], and saw to it
that I always had a place to go to.

Webb:

Describe the job.

Craig:

This was simply a nursery school job. These were
children, again, from very rich families, many of them
divorced. The children were brought in the morning by
anybody—by the mother, the father, the maid or whoever. I

4

don't think that any of them stayed all day—it was sort of
before the day care center for the rich came into being. But I
learned about these parents, again, the kind of people that they
were—these were old Fhiladelphians, many of them, Curtis Bok
being one of them—so this was an eye opener to me in a way,
just to see that there were lots of broken families, and that
any kind of a nursery school or elementary school where people
really cared about the children was good.
There was an English couple there teaching, who were
excellent. They were beautiful teachers, for one thing, and
they tried very, very hard to get me to go to Black Mountain
College. I don't know whether you knew that or not, but, again,
this was a progressive school that I was teaching in, and Black
Mountain was the nearest thing to a progressive college that
there was, certainly not a traditional college. But I couldn't
take that yet, and I never applied. Hard as they tried to get
me to, I didn't do it.
Webb:

You were very resistant to the idea of going to college.

Craig:

Very. Going to do anything else where I had to sit in the
classroom ever. So the director, I guess he was called, of the
Mequan[?] School had been a teacher for a long time, and he took
it upon himself, again, to give me things to read, and he would
take me off, maybe once every week or so, and go through the
stuff that I had read and the stuff that I was doing and in this
way just to give me a little more insight into what it was I was
supposed to be doing, and into teaching.

Webb:

So it was like a tutorial for you, then.

5

Craig:

Yeah. Umhm. So I felt I learned, again, a great deal
there, which stood me in good stead.

Webb:

Do you feel that you achieved a greater understanding of
your own family situation because of working with these children
in this particular school?

Craig:

Umhm. And also in the contacts with Dorothy McFarland and
her home situation. I was learning all the time about different
ways that families live.

Webb:

It sounds as if you were very receptive, because you
needed understanding, you needed to understand your own
situation.

Craig:

Umhm. It was in many ways a difficult time. I had to
drive all the from Westchester, Pennsylvania, which is way
outside of the mainline, even—it was about an hour and a half
away. The first year I was teaching there, my sister went to
Bryn Mawr College, so we were able to drive together. The
second year, she had quit. I had to drive myself, and I really
wasn't—well, I hadn't done a great deal of driving, but it was
a very hazardous drive, in the winter particularly. The winters
then were very, very severe, and I had to, all by myself
(laughs), take this car and drive all of this hour and a half,
or whatever it was, to get to work, and that was why, often when
the weather was so bad, I simply stayed with Dorothy McFarland
instead of going home.

Webb:

So do you feel that you could trace the roots of your
interest in child care to this experience?

Craig:

Yes, certainly. But probably more to the London

6

experience, because that was Mien I learned that I had the
ability to work with atypical people and children.
Webb:

All right. New, since we've skipped backwards, let's skip
ahead new, back to Gordon. So you returned to the U.S. engaged,
and in the meantime you had broken up with a young man in
Pennsylvania.

Craig:

Yeah. (Laughs.)

Webb:

Did he knew about this

Craig:

Who, Gordon?

Webb:

No, your—

Craig:

Oh, the other one? (Laughs.)

Webb:

—•

?

friend in Pennsylvania, did he know about it

before you came home?
Craig:

He was fearful, he was fearful, as soon as he knew that I
was going to live away and in London. He still had hopes, but
he decided that that was probably the end.

Webb:

So Mien you came back to Pennsylvania—let's pick up on
your life there. What happened?

Craig:

Well, first of all, we had intended to be married then,
and Gordon was going to take a job at some ridiculous pay, like
$800 a month, or something, at Indiana or Illinois or one of
those places, and we were just going to live however we could.
But then, he got an offer of a fellowship in the graduate school
at Princeton, but he had to be a bachelor to accept. (laughs.)
So, it was so much more money, and he needed this time, because
he was working on his Ph.D., so we didn't get married. So then
he was in Princeton, and I then went to live, for the first time

7

in many years, with my mother.
Webb:

Where was that?

Craig:

Well, she had an apartment in the Barclay[?] Hotel in
Bittenhouse[?] Square in Philadelphia. She furnished my room
with very pretty things, antiques—she was a great antique
collector. Some of the things I still have. That was a trial
in itself, but we survived. I spent weekends either in
Princeton or back with my father, who, by this time, had
remarried and lived in still another town, Malvern[?],
Pennsylvania. That year, then, I taught in a nursery school in
the University of Pennsylvania Hospital, on Thirtieth Street.
This was a nursery school for normal children, except that,
because it was in the mental health unit of the hospital, we did
occasionally get some borderline children. I didn't pay an
awful lot of attention, I think—that school didn't mean that
much to me. It meant a lot to me to be in the unit where my
mother was also being treated—her psychiatrist was in that
unit. Not that I ever had any connection with him, really, but
it was just kind of interesting to be working in that hospital.

Webb:

So Gordon was in Princeton, and how long was he there as a
Ph.D. student?

Craig:

Just the one year. And then we were married at the end of
that, because his fellowship—this nice fellowship—only lasted
for the one year.

Webb:

Did he get his Ph.D. in one year?

Craig:

Oh, no. No, no. He didn't get that until three or four
years, three years later, I guess.

8

Webb:

So you got married, knowing that Gordon was going to be in
the academic world. And how did you envision life as being the
wife of someone who was going to be a

Craig:

?

Well, I don't think I did envision it at all, because I
had no image to know what it was I was getting into. He got a
very good job as an instructor, which they don't even have these
days, at Yale, and so, for the first two years, then, we lived
in New Haven and made a lot of friends there, also. I did not
have a job. He worked hard not only teaching but then also on
his doctorate, and I did his typing. The war, you see, then was
coming on us, because this was in '40 and '41, you see, 1939 and
'40. And then, Yale made the mistake of dropping not only him
from the faculty but a couple of other very—since became very
famous professors. He then was offered a job at Princton and
took it. We, by that time, had had our first child. The war
had something to do with this, too. We were concerned—I guess
we were all concerned—wondering what would happen to us and the
families and whatever. So we decided to have a child, and did,
and she was born in New Haven in May, and we left in June.

Webb:

How did World War II affect your life?

Craig:

Oh, in many ways, because Gordon did various things, you
see, throughout the war. When we moved to Princton, we expected
to be there actually indefinitely. But because of the coming of
the war, he accepted a position in the Office of Strategic
Services, and we had to move to Washington. So we were in
Princeton only a year. Then we moved, lived in a little row
house in Arlington, Virginia, with our daughter; again met some

9

of the same friends that we'd had in Oxford, who had also gone
into government work; and also people from Yale were
there,

were there, too. So we had quite a

circle of friends, and this was, I guess, quite satisfactory for
him. He became an African expert, which is what happened to
people in the war—even though he was a modern European
historian, he was put in the African section. But, he was a
researcher, and he knew what to do, and so he boned up on Africa
and wrote reports on Africa.
Webb:

How would you describe life for yourself in Arlington at
that time?

Craig:

Well, it was different. Arlington was sort of a swamp at
that time, and there was this one row of houses sort of along
the edge of a freeway. We had some good friends from New Haven
who were there, too, fortunately, and they had a boy just a
little bit older than my daughter Susan. We had no car. So it
was different.

Webb:

Did Gordon work normal office hours, or did he have loner
hours?

Craig:

No, I think they were pretty normal. He had to take the
train or the bus in—I forget which it was that he took—and the
same out again. We had a fair social life because of all of
these friends that were also working in Washington. So that was
sort of fun.

Webb:

Did you have any concerns that he would be sent off
overseas?

Craig:

Oh, sure. And he never really knew what he was going to

10

do. I guess many of these sort of intellectual types really
didn't know whether they would be kept on in government or would
want to stay on in government. And then, also, in the
universities, you see, they were running training programs. So
that's what Gordon came back to at Princton then.
Webb:

Hew long was he in Washington?

Craig:

Just a year.

Webb:

One year. And then he went back to Princeton.

Craig:

Then back to Princton, and was involved in officers'
training courses and whatever, where they had to learn history
and had to learn various other things in the humanities and
sciences. So, again, many of our academic friends were involved
this way during sort of the middle years of the war. And then
he decided to became a Marine (laughs), and did. This guy was
all set in his academic career and decided that he wanted to
became a Marine, so he went to Officers' Training School in
Quantico, came out as a captain, and—

Webb:

Where were you during that time?

Craig:

Oh, all over. With him part of the time and became
pregnant again—I can't really remember when who was born—but I
shifted around a good deal but was pregnant with our second
daughter when he was shipped overseas. Meanwhile, our first
daughter had contracted mumps, and Gordon was in training, and
gave mumps to our next-door neighbor, who was an enormous macho
flier, who got mumps from our daughter, and that was a very
rough thing (laughs). We didn't hear the end of that for a long
time.

11

Webb:

Were there any lasting consequences?

Craig:

(Laughs heartily.) Well, they had two children, I think,
at the time. Whether they ever wanted any more, I don't know
(laughs), or could have had after this, but they were pretty
angry people, really angry at that, so—

Webb:

How did you handle that?

Craig:

(Laughs.) Well, I was apologetic. What else could I be?
We had a doctor, but mumps can do funny things, and the doctor
wasn't all that certain that she had mumps. So, I guess we took
normal precautions, but not extranormal precautions, because we
weren't really sure she had mumps. We found out that she had
mumps when I got them, when I was pregnant, anyway. But we had
moved away by that time and gone to stay with some friends in
New Haven just prior to Gordon's departure. These, again, were
very good friends—this was a Princeton classmate and our
daughter Susan's godfather—so they knew that this was going to
be a hard thing for me, being pregnant and whatever, so they
took very good care of us when Gordon took off for the South
Pacific.

Webb:

So, you were being a wife and a mother during these war
years. And how long was Gordon in the South Pacific?

Craig:

Well, only, again, about a year. And he never saw any
action, because of his intelligence position. He was sent in to
look over places and to make reports and whatever, but he never
did see any action, fortunately. He did a lot of traveling
around the islands, but he was in Honolulu when the war ended.

Webb:

When he came back after the war, he returned to Princton

12

as a faculty member?
Craig:

Returned to Princton, urrihm, as an assistant professor by
that time.

Webb:

And was that something that you welcomed?

Craig:

Sure. I'd been—

Webb:

Did you like your life at Princton?

Craig:

Yes, I did. I liked it very much. And we'd by that time,
then, had two-and-a-half-children (laughs), and so my concern
was always where we were going to live. Gordon, looking over
his diary today when I got home from work, was astonished to
find that, in his accounts of those years, he never said where
we were living. And I realized then that it didn't matter to
him where we were. It mattered a great deal to me but not to
him. And we moved several times, right within Princton, in
faculty housing.

Webb:

What did you think was expected of you as a faculty wife
at Princeton?

Craig:

Well, our first year there was when things were very
formal. That was when we first moved down from New Haven, when
we were supposed to put on white gloves and take our calling
cards, two from our husband's and one of ours, and go and call
on the older faculty women. And they were supposed to do the
same first to us. They would come, and we were supposed to have
the card tray, and they were going to leave the card there. And
then we had to return these calls. Well, it was that year when
it fortunately was brought home to these women that this wasn't
going to wash, that we were not going to be the kinds of wives

13

any more who were going to be willing to lead that kind of
completely organized social lives.
Webb:

What happened to change that?

Craig:

The war. People were coming and going a great deal, and—

Webb:

The war disrupted—

Craig:

Oh, yes. It really simply flattened this whole, very
rigid, social scheme at Princeton. And whether this happened in
other places, I don't knew. But it was interesting that it
seemed to happen so quickly, 'cause there was none of that by
the time we got permanently back to Princeton.

Webb:

So, after the war, then, you felt that no one expected
anything of you as a faculty wife.

Craig:

That's right. We did certainly our share of entertaining,
as everybody did, and there was a lot more of it then than there
is now amongst faculty people.

Webb:

What kind of entertaining?

Craig:

Well, dinners, but—

Webb:

Dinner parties for other faculty?

Craig:

Dinner parties. Yeah. Umhm. Almost entirely faculty. I
had other friends, friends other than faculty, because I had
their children in a group. But wives were not expected to work
at all, and I guess it didn't occur to them. Princeton was a
very small town at that time, and there really weren't jobs for
people. Everybody's kids went to the public schools, and the
mothers took care of the kids.

Webb:

Now you started a play group in Princeton. Why did you
happen to do that?

14

Craig:

Well, I'd been away from any kind of work for a long
time. We lived on the third floor in a big house—it was our
doctor's house—and I felt that Susan needed friends to play
with, and I was pregnant, and I thought I'd try it. And it
worked. So I had about five kids, non-university children, and
I don; 't even remember how I got them, where they came from.
Maybe I put an ad in the paper—I think I probably did. We
built a sandbox and a swing, down the three flights of stairs,
and I would take the kids down there. But these, again, have
remained friends, these people, these non-university people.
And that was fun.

Webb:

So you started, then, as a way to get playmates for your
own daughter, and then later you formed a cooperative nursery
school.

Craig:

Umhm. For the third daughter. (Laughs.)

Webb:

For the third daughter. All right. How did you happen to
get involved with the formation of the nursery school?

Craig:

A little bit out of envy. We lived, at that time, in
College Road in Princeton, which is a long row of attached
faculty apartment houses, and my children's best friends lived
about five doors down—girls the same age as my three girls.
And their mother had decided that she would start a co-op
nursery school in one of the town-owned buildings. It could
only take—oh, I don't know—twelve children, or something like
that. It was a thing that didn't interest me at the time.
Nobody knew anything about the education of young children, in
this group. It was a social sort of thing. And I decided we

15

needed more than that—that we needed a real school, a real
nursery school. So I decided not to go in with them—I don't
even know that they wanted me in. I decided to start my own and
do it for the university, not for the town, because I felt that
was where it was necessary, for us to get going in the
university. So I did, and I think we opened our doors at
virtually the same time, these two schools. (Laughs.)
Webb:

You approached the university for support, and what was
their response?

Craig:

Well, I approached the University Leauge, which was the
faculty women's group. Harold Dodds was president then, and his
wife Marjorie was the sort of titular head of the University
league, I guess, and they jumped at it, they thought this was a
great idea. They couldn't really understand what it was all
about or how it would happen, but there just must have been . .
. I had some other good friends also on the board of the
University league, and I guess I was on the board myself by that
time. Nobody was interested in doing anything about it, but
they just thought it was a good idea. So they went to Harold
Dodds and to the dean of the faculty and put it to them. And
for whatever reason—I do not know—they agreed to give me some
money, provided I could find a place to have this, which, you
know, wasn't easy, even in Princeton. So I did find a place.
It was a big, big old house that had been turned into—the
downstairs of which had been a kindergarten, and those people
were moving, and so we were able to get the downstairs—there
was a whole first floor—and the

16

playground
Webb:

.

You make it sound as though it was easy to convince them
to do this for you.

Craig:

Well, I think it must have been. And, as I say, I'm not
really sure, except that I had good friends. I don't think that
anybody had ever thought of doing this, so it couldn't have been
in their minds. They knew, first of all, that I'd had
experience with nursery schools, and they must have recognized
that this could be a good thing for Princeton.

Webb:

Well, it seems as though you must have the facility to get
people to collaborate with you—

Craig:

I guess.

Webb:

—because it's really a success story that you were able
to get this building at Princeton, and then it was a cooperative
thing, so parents helped, right?

Craig:

Oh, yes. The money that we got from the University League
went into renovating the downstairs. There was really a good
deal—a lot of painting that had to be done and a lot of things
and the bathrooms had to be cleaned up and then there had to be
playground structures built outside. How I did it on that
amount of money, I don't know. But the parents really did pitch
in. Once it was known that there was going to be a place for
these children to go, the faculty children, then they worked—

Webb:

Someone always has to spearhead the idea and enlist
support

Craig:

Well, there was just a very good bunch of parents. And,
again, I think the mothers were probably looking for something

17

to do. The war had somewhat upset their lives, too, and they'd
all come back, and it was something they could get their teeth
into, that made some sense.
Phyllis, what was your role over the next years at the

Webb:

nursery school in Princeton; after you founded the nursery
school, what was your role?
Craig:

Director. Teacher-director, 'cause I, first of all
taught the four-year-old group. It was a half-time job, so
called. My own children needed attention, too, and so did—that
school ran only in the mornings. This was one of the early
preschools. So I had the four-year-old group, and I also had a
parent board of directors, and I had two other teachers, one for
the three-year-olds and one for—it must have been two for some
groups—we didn't have two-year-olds at the beginning, so I must
have had two teachers for—anyway, there were three of us
teaching for this group of children from ages of three to
four-and-a-half, sort of. And so, my role, really, was as a
teacher and as the director of the school and the one who had to
keep it going and make decisions along with the parent board. I
had to learn how to work with parents, which isn't easy. Some
of them were friends of mine and some of them weren't.
One of the interesting things that I just thought of today
is that, amongst the parents was the first woman in the graduate
school at Princton. They never had had women before, and so
she—

Webb:

You mean, as a faculty person.

Craig:

No, as a graduate student.

Webb:

Oh, as a graduate student.

Craig:

INTERVIEW WITH PHYLLIS CRAIG
TAPE 2
NOVEMBER 18, 1986

Webb:

This is Tape 2, Side 1 of the interview with Phyllis
Craig. Phyllis, can you talk about the time that you were the
director at the cooperative nursery school in Princeton. How
did the program develop over the years?

Craig:

First of all, when we had to move from Libby[?] House, the
first place where we had the school, there was always the fear
that we wouldn't get another place to go. I'm used to this by
this time, but I wasn't then, and I had to spend a lot of time
persuading the administration of Princeton that we had to have
another building and that it had to appropriate to the nursery
school for children.
There was a wonderful man by the name of Colonel Fox, and
I don't know exactly what his position was, but I guess he was
the vice-president for administrative affairs, or something like
that. And he was very sympathetic—he'd never been married, nor
any children, nor anything else, but he was very sympathetic,
(laughs.) So he finally secured for us a barracks building on

2

the edge of the campus, which turned out to be absolutely
perfect for a nursery school. But it meant that, all over
again, we had to paint and work on the structure and create a
whole new playground and everything.
So, that's sort of the story of my life, but the school
was going on all the same, while all of this was happening.
Also, the parents would go—often they were there with their
children for at least two years, and they became more accustomed
to what their role had to be, not only as board members making
the decisions and setting the policy with me, but also as
participants in the classrooms, which, of course, was part of
their—
Webb:

How did they participate in the classroom?

Craig:

As a teacher's assistant, teacher's aide. And since our
classes were much smaller than most classes these days—they had
only twelve children in them—it meant that we were very—the
two adults working in the class—we were close, and then we
didn't have to lay out curriculum plans and all that sort of
stuff; we could simply talk to each other.

Webb:

Were you teaching in the program?

Craig:

Umhm, yes, I was teaching.

Webb:

You were the director and—

Craig:

—and the teacher, of the four-year-olds, the oldest
group. So, when we went into this new building, I, at that
time, had come to know Kathryn[?] Whiteside Taylor, who was a—I
knew her only through phone conversations and the mail system,
but she had been instrumental in setting up co-ops in Oregon and

Washington and California. She had a newsletter that I used to
write for, and one of the projects that I had was a noisy room,
which was sort of intriguing. We had an extra room in this
barracks building, and I turned it into a large-muscle activity
room, which we called the noisy room, and one of our
artist-fathers painted beautiful murals all over the walls. And
so that was kind of fun, and I got to be known just in this
newsletter through this noisy room. And I used to get hints on
various things that were happening in publications that were out
from Kathryn[?] Whiteside Taylor. She was the only sort of
nationally known person that I was in contact with.
Then there was also the woman who was—I don't even know
what her title was—right now she would be called the licensing
person in the department of social services or human resources,
but at that time she was the person, at any rate, who had to
license nursery schools and who was responsible for seeing to it
that the teachers were qualified and kept up with their
education.
This is the state of New Jersey?
This is the state of New Jersey. And she and I became
very good friends. It was she who pointed me in the direction
of taking courses at Rutgers and Newark and Trenton, which I did
from time to time, courses on specific things that had to do
with preschool education, like art and music and literature and
administration, this kind of thing.
How did these courses affect the evolution of the program
in your school?

4

Craig:

Well, they made me think a lot about what teachers I was
going to hire, for one thing. And I think they just made the
school certainly a better place, because I knew more about what
I was doing and what the other adults should be doing. It also
resulted in my getting a certificate as a preschool director,
which was very useful later on to me. So, that happened.
Then—you know, I get bored rather easily with jobs, I
guess—so I decided that we needed two-year-olds in the school.
So, I started an afternoon group for two-year-olds, after nap
time. It began at 2:30 in the afternoon, or 2:00—I've
forgotten. I had a wonderful group of two-year-olds, and that
was fun. And I still have them. But that was pretty much
unheard of, to have anybody as young as that in any kind of an
organized structure.

Webb:

How did you manage all this?—working and taking care of
your own family—you had three little girls—

Craig:

Well, it wasn't easy, I guess, but it was, in a sense, a
half-time job, that was what it was supposed to be, and whatever
administrative things I needed to do I just did at night.
Again, teaching schedules for professors at that time, I think,
were much different, or maybe it was just because Gordon was
younger and didn't have so many other things to do, but he was
actually able to be home between classes. He might have a
couple of classes one day and not have anything else in the
afternoon, or things like that. So he was able to spell me.

Webb:

He was available to support you.

Craig:

He was available. And I had a wonderful cleaning woman,

5

who took the bus from Trenton two or three times a week and came
to my house and did the cleaning and took care of whatever
children were sick and couldn't go to school, and that kind of
thing. I had a bevy of teen-agers who would baby-sit. So it
really wasn't too difficult to do.
Webb:

Were you the only faculty wife who had a job?

Craig:

One of them—the only other one I can think of at the
moment who had a real job, a much harder job than I had, she was
a psychotherapist, and this was, again, a very difficult
profession in a small town like Princeton. She and I agonized
over this many times, and she finally did set up an office and
did get some clients, but—in a city like Trenton you could do
this, but Princeton was a very close society. They didn't think
they needed a psychotherapist. So that was a hard row to hoe.

Webb:

How do you think the other faculty wives viewed you and
the other woman, who had careers or jobs?

Craig:

Well, the other one did not have children, so that didn't
make quite so much difference. She could do whatever she wanted
to do. I have no idea. I think that, since so many of them had
children in the school, they couldn't really think it was the
wrong thing for me to do. I don't think it inspired anybody
else to go to work, because there weren't any jobs. Princeton
was a little place, and there really were no jobs for them.

Webb:

Now, you received support from the university in the form
of buildings in which to have the school. Did you receive any
other support?

Craig:

No.

6

Webb:

No. The operation had to pay for itself.

Craig:

Oh, yes.

Webb:

But you did have the building, you did have the space,
free of rent.

Craig:

Urrihm. That's right. We had to maintain it, and the
fathers did that.

Webb:

Did Gordon have any role in this school?

Craig:

Yes. He never had to work in the classroom, that I can
remember, but our youngest daughter was only in it for one year
before she went to kindergarten, and then it was eleven years
before our son got into it. But he did—he would come—often he
would pitch in on work days, that kind of thing—but the best
thing he did was to come and play his guitar for the children.
(Laughs.) Everybody loved that.

Webb:

(Laughs.) Well, it sounds though he enjoyed it, too.

Craig:

Oh, yes, he did, he enjoyed that part of it, at any rate.
uh huh. But he was very good about staying home and taking care
of the kids if I had to go out.

Webb:

Now, after you had established the school—seven or eight
years or so afterward—you did come to Stanford. Can you tell
us about that?

Craig:

Yes. That was quite a break, a difficult one, for me to
leave the school. I left it in charge of a very good friend of
mine who had been teaching but who certainly was not an
administrator at all, and I did this with some trepidation. But
everything worked out all right, because we happened to have at
that time a very good parent—mother—who pretty well took over

and saw that everything ran well. And I was in correspondence
with her while I was in California. So, we brought—this was an
adventure, there's no question about it, going to—that sort of
was an adventure in those days anyway. We rented the home, the
George Knolls' [?] home. He was a history professor, away for
the summer, and they lived on Foothill in the kind of house we'd
never lived in, a real California house, complete with cactus
garden and all this kind of stuff, and—
Was this your first trip to California?
First trip to California. So—
And Gordon was at the Center for the Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences for a year.
He was at the Center. Uh huh. For a year. And actually
accomplished a good deal in terms of his own work, his own
writing, and what not, at that time. But, again, it was a very
social year, because there was just that kind of a crowd of
professors there, who liked to dance and liked to sing and liked
to play instruments, and so there was—oh, there were parties
all the time. I can stand only so much of that, and I decided
that I was wasting my time. We had one daughter in high school,
another one in junior high and another one in elementary school,
so they were gone all day. And so I—I don't even remember how
I heard about it, but I volunteered as a teacher, or a teacher's
assistant, in the old Children's Health Council, which was then
on Charming Street, in a little old house on Charming Street,
and got to know Betty Miller, who was the director, and Esther
Clark, who was the founder and a physician. So, I worked there

8

for I guess really about six months, five or six months,
meanwhile being pregnant.
Webb:

This is as a volunteer.

Craig:

This is as a volunteer, and very pregnant. But that
was

. So,

the connections that I made there were very good.
Webb:

What was it like for your children that year at Stanford?

Craig:

Very different for all of them. The high school daughter
was the—got to—Joan Baez, for instance, was in her class at
Paly High, and they became good friends. It wasn't easy for a
high school person to move just for one year to another high
school. The junior high daughter probably had a good time, but
we were horrified at what went on in the junior high school
system in Palo Alto. There—

Webb:

Now, what year was this?

Craig:

'56 and '57. She went to—it wasn't Jordan, it was the
other one, I forget the name of it now, but—

Webb:

Terman?

Craig:

No, there was still another one.

Webb:

Wilbur.

Craig:

Wilbur, that one. A lot of the parents of her friends
were divorced. There were parties given in these houses without
the parents present. The girls were lathered in make-up. And
it was a kind of life that we didn't know anything about at all
and were very fearful of what was going to became of this
daughter. And I think it shaped her life a good deal.

Webb:

So there was nothing like this at Princeton?

9

Craig:

No, there was not. And it was just a whole different kind
of life for her and for us. For the high school and for the
elementary school, it was pretty much what we had known from
Princeton, but not the junior high system. We had a different
system in the public schools at Princeton, but there was nothing
like this kind of life, completely free and open life, for these
junior high kids.

Webb:

How did you handle that?

Craig:

Probably not very well. I did the best I could to
encourage her to be careful, and she became sort of alienated
from her sisters because her life was so different from theirs.
She went to a lot of parties and wasn't paying much attention to
her studies

, and I really do believe that it did

shape her life. She was the only one of our four children who
couldn't get into Stanford. She was very bright, but she simply
had, in that year had just decided that studying was not for
her. She wanted a good time and was going to be independent,
and we had to be very careful about this. So that was her.
And, as I say, the others just went to school here just the way
they would have gone to school in Princeton.
Webb:

And you got pregnant while you were here?

Craig:

While we were here, and went home—

Webb:

How did that affect your life? (Laughs.)

Craig:

(Laughs.) Well, in many ways. I was working with
retarded and neurologically damaged children. I was 39, and how
did I know I was going to have a normal child? I didn't. So I
was fearful in some ways. I tried not to think about this, but

10

I couldn't really help it, when I looked at so many of these
children who had been born when their mothers were my age and
older. There wasn't, at that time, the mechanism for finding
out whether you have a damaged child or not. So, at any rate,
between being scared of that and wondering what in heaven's name
I was going to do when I got back to Princeton, that was why I
worked—it was really good for me to go to work, and—
Webb:

Therapeutic

.

Craig:

Yeah. Oh, absolutely. To have something to do every day.

Webb:

So when you went back to Princeton, did you resume your
role in the nursery school?

Craig:

Well, Charlie was born on the first of October. We went
back about the first of July, or something like that, by train,
and if you've ever traveled on the train when you're pregnant,
with a dog and three other children, it's (laughs) something
else. So, I got back into contact with everybody, when I got
back to Princeton—although we may also—we may have gone to New
Hampshire for part of that time? I think we did. We had
summered in New Hampshire for many years, and so I think we
went—actually, we had rented our house in Princeton, so we went
to New Hampshire first. So that was a kind of relaxing time,
and that was nice.

Webb:

Were you anticipating a happy return to Princeton. Were
you relieved that you were going back?

Craig:

Well, I guess we'd never thought that we wouldn't, so
there wasn't any question. We loved California, and Gordon had
various bites on jobs here and there, mostly in Berkeley—

11

Webb:

But it sounds as though it was also a stressful year for
you.

Craig:

It was, in a way, but, you knew, it really wasn't—I don't
think it was as stressful, probably, for us as it was for these
other people. As I said, so many of them got divorced, two of
them committed suicide; so we made out all right in that
respect. I was anxious to get back to see what was happening
with the school, and I knew that the person I'd left in charge
was not wanting to continue in charge—she knew that she
couldn't and I knew that she couldn't. So, it was good to get
back. I obviously could not really go to work until after
Charlie was born, in the first of October, but I did shortly
thereafter. And, again, Gordon was able to be home off and on
during the week, so that he could take care of him. Then, he
had older sisters by that time, who could also take very good
care of him. So, we just sort of got back into the old pattern
by going to work.

Webb:

And hew long did you continue that?

Craig:

Well, until we moved out here, you see.

Webb:

And did Charlie go to the school, too?

Craig:

Charlie went to the school and thrived on it. Gordon,
meanwhile, had had offers from various other places to work.
The one that caused us the most trouble was in Columbia, which
would have meant a real difference in life between Columbia
University and Princeton, but because of my school, we decided
that, if he were to accept that, we would still live in
Princeton, but we couldn't live in university housing any more.

We would have to find another place to live. And I didn't want
to bring up the kids in New York City. So, he thought long and
hard about that, and we visited, we did all sorts of things.
But in the long run, Princeton topped the offer and kept him,
thank goodness, because I don't think that . . . He would have
loved it, because he's crazy about New York City, but I wouldn't
have. So, then, as I say, there were various others, and there
was also, then, this business of from Berkeley, which he really
thought would be the California offer—he thought it would be to
go to Berkeley.
So, you were both desirous of returning to California.
Well, we didn't know until we got a firm offer from
anywhere. We weren't sitting around saying, gee, I hope we get
an offer to go to California. But we looked back on the year
with great fondness, and I loved, I just loved, the
countryside. And Princeton, again, by that time, was becoming a
bit shoddy, very crowded, and we felt as if we were meeting each
other walking up and down the street. We'd done everything
there was to do in Princeton. And so, we were ready to move,
even though this didn't occur to any of our friends,
apparently. They were happy to live and die in Princeton, but
we really weren't. So

—

So, how did you happen to come back to Stanford?
(Laughs.) Well, one Sunday at lunch time, the telephone
rang, and it was Gordon Wright[?], who was the chairman of the
history department at that time, and he said, how'd you like to
come to Stanford? And Gordon came in and told me, I said,

13

[makes a whooping sound] LET'S GO! So he accepted (laughs)
there on the spot. And, we've never regretted it, obviously.
It didn't seem like such a tremendous upheaval as it would have,
had we not spent the one year here before. And we were really
ready for it.
So, you came to Stanford the second time as the wife of a
history professor, in the history department. How did you see
your role then?
Well, again, you see, I have to separate myself from any
role as a wife, because, as soon as I knew we were coming here,
I wrote to the director of the Children's Health Council saying,
I'm coming, I would like a job. I got a letter back immediately
saying, you got it. And so I was preparing for that. Also, we
had a four-year-old boy, we had a daughter at Swarthmore and
another daughter just graduating from high school. So we had a
lot to think about. I had to come out and buy a house, which I
did by myself, because Gordon couldn't come. And anyway, we
couldn't afford to both of us come, so I came out and bought a
house. And so I saw myself as having to fix up a big house, and
then we had the decision of what the Swarthmore daughter should
do: Should she transfer to Stanford?—which she did. What
should the other daughter do? I mean, there were all of these
things, so I didn't have time to think about what I was going to
do as a Stanford wife. I really didn't.
But in the meantime, you were still being director of the
nursery school there.
Urrihm.

14

Did you think about starting a nursery school at Stanford?
No, because I wanted to work at the Health Council. That
was my great ambition at that time—was to get back to the
Health Council and work there.
What was there about the Health Council that was so
enticing to you?
Working with handicapped children. As I say—you know,
there are people who can do this and people who can't, and I had
found out that I could, when I was volunteering, when we were
out here at the Center.
Was that more of a challenge to you than the nursery
school?
Oh, yes. Oh, you bet. It became more and more of a one
as time went on, but it—you see, I'd been working really on my
own at the nursery school. At the Health Council there were
physicians, there were psychiatrists, there were psychologists,
there were speech therapists, all of these people working with
the same children that I would be working with. That was indeed
a challenge for me, and I knew that I'd learn a lot. I expected
to be just a teacher. I found out when I got here that they
were going to fire the director, whom I had known before, and
put me in her place, which was difficult for her, and a wee bit
for me, too. But she understood; she hadn't had the training
that I had; she had no certificate of her own. So, I didn't
know that when we moved out here; I thought I would just be a
teacher. But that soon changed.
So you had a job waiting for you. And were there any

15

surprises in that job when you—
Craig:

Every day, every day.

Webb:

Did you start as soon as you got here?

Craig:

Yes, well, well, as soon as Charlie got—Charlie went to
Bing[?] that year. Gordon's mother came out to live with us,
which helped me a great deal, obviously, and by the time Susan
had got—Susan lived at home and went to Stanford—and so I had
the home to think about and how that was going to work out with
all of them. And so, to be perfectly honest, I wasn't paying an
awful lot of attention to how Gordon was getting on. I knew he
was perfectly capable of doing whatever it was he had to do.
And so I wasn't really concerned, as long as I knew his friends,
and we made mutual friends and we did things with them. That
was all, again, that was ever required of a wife.

Webb:

So, when you arrived at the Health Council, did you start
working as soon as you arrived, as soon as you got here?

Craig:

Almost. Well, when the kids got into school.

Webb:

And then you found out that you were going to be the
director almost immediately?

Craig:

Yeah. Umhm. And there were lots of changes taking place
there, too. Structurally, as far as the building was
concerned. And I made many changes in the school when I was
there, just sort of instinctual kinds of changes. But the most
exciting thing was really working with the medical director, who
didn't have the ability to work well with parents, but with
children he was simply superb. And so, more and more I did
things with him, when he was examining children. Then I would

16

go and be there at the same time. So I learned an awful lot
this way.
So you were learning from—were you also—what was the
reason why you went in with him to examine the children?
I guess because I wanted to and because I felt that he was
not good in talking to the parents.
Oh. So, you felt that your role was to be a bridge, then,
between him and the parents.
Well, at least to be present, so that I could break into
this kind of dry dialogue that was going on between—well, it
was dry on his part; it wasn't on theirs—they were very anxious
parents, obviously. But I could, from knowing the children, I
could at least clue them in a little bit to what the next years
were going to be like for these children. And I knew about the
public school system here, and who was going to get into it and
who wasn't, and that kind of thing.
What kinds of problems did the children at the Health
Council have?
You name it, they had it. Some of them were—
theoretically, they were not severely retarded. The C.A.R. [?]
was supposed to be taking care of the severely retarded.
However, we did have some Down's syndrome children. We had more
and more seriously emotionally disturbed children, which was the
way the Clinic was going—getting rid of some of the more
retarded and taking on the more emotionally disturbed, which
eventually was why I left. But, we had children with hearing
difficulties, children with—and the rarest diseases, the names

17

of which I've now forgotten—but children who had to be handled
very carefully physically, children who didn't grow, children
who were rambunctious, violent, everything. We really had
absolutely everything. And I liked it that way. I hated to see
the retarded go, because we really could work with them. For
the first year, as I was working into being director, I was also
a teacher, thank goodness, because it would have been difficult
for me to have been a director [End of Side A]

PHYLLIS CRAIG INTERVIEW
TAPE 3
DECEMBER 9, 1986

Webb:

. . . Alto, on December 9, 1986. This is Mimi Webb
interviewing Phyllis Craig. Phyllis, hew did you became
involved with the child care program at Stanford?

Craig:

It was mostly due to Dorothea Almond's[?] persuasion. She
had been instrumental in getting a child care section going in
the Faculty Women's Club, and so she wanted me to come in on
that with her. She had been on the sort of periphery of the
child care movement at Stanford and felt that she needed a
companion in this. So I came along to see what I could do.

Webb:

Because the child care program has already been covered in
campus publications over the years, we don't want to cover old
ground. What's not in the record? What's the unreported side?

Craig:

The unreported side, obviously, is everything that went on
behind the scenes. It was declared in the child care policy,
the Leifer[?] Report, that child care was to be under the Dean
of Student Affairs' office, so that is where we had to begin in
order to became really involved in finding a place for the
Children's Center and getting it going.
In order to work with the Dean of Students, who was Jim

2

Lyons[?] and still is, I was introduced to Dan Williams, who was
at that time the Associate Dean of Student Affairs. He has
since left Stanford and gone to Oregon, I believe. But any
rate, he had an office in Tressider. He was not only the
Associate Dean of Student Affairs? he was also the director of
Tressider Union? and he and I did a great deal of talking about
how I could work in as either a director, or as at least a
counselor and advisor to the Children's Center. So, for quite
some while, we just talked about what to do. I didn't have an
