Introduction
This oral history was conducted by Judy Adams and transcribed by the Stanford Historical
Society Oral History Program.
The Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program furthers the Society’s mission “to
foster and support the documentation, study, publication, dissemination, and preservation of
the history of the Leland Stanford Junior University.” The program explores the institutional
history of the University, with an emphasis on the transformative post-WWII period,
through interviews with leading faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and others. The interview
recordings and transcripts provide valuable additions to the existing collection of written and
photographic materials in the Stanford University Archives.
Oral history is not a final, verified, or complete narrative of events. It is a unique, reflective,
spoken account, offered by the interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it may be
deeply personal. Each oral history is a reflection of the past as the interviewee remembers
and recounts it. But memory and meaning vary from person to person; others may recall
events differently. Used as primary source material, any one oral history will be compared
with and evaluated in light of other evidence, such as contemporary texts and other oral
histories, in arriving at an interpretation of the past. Although the interviewees have a past or
current connection with Stanford University, they are not speaking as representatives of the
University.
Each transcript is edited by program staff and by the interviewee for grammar, syntax, and
occasional inaccuracies and to aid in overall clarity and readability--but is not fact-checked as
such. The approach is to maintain the substantive content of the interview as well as the
interviewee’s voice. As a result of this editing process, the transcript may not match the
recording verbatim. If a substantive deletion has been made, this is generally indicated at the
relevant place on the transcript. Substantive additions are noted in brackets or by footnote.
All uses of the interview transcript and recording are covered by a legal agreement between
the interviewee and the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University

Abstract
In this 1988 interview, Nannerl Keohane, then a former associate professor of political
science at Stanford and current president at Wellesley College, discusses women’s issues
from the perspective of a woman in academia and provides an account of the early days of
the Center for Research on Women (CROW) and feminist studies at Stanford. She relates
how her research interests turned to focus on feminism and speaks about the discrimination
that women faced in an academic setting. Keohane also discusses the importance of her
close friendships and bonds with other female faculty members at Stanford, including Shelly
Rosaldo, Estelle Freedman, Myra Strober, Diane Middlebrook, and Barbara Babcock. She
recalls the early days of the Stanford Center for Research on Women (CROW), which grew
into the Institute for Research on Women and Gender (IRWG) and is now the Michelle R.
Clayman Institute for Gender Research. She reflects on the lasting impact these pioneering
women had on Stanford and the field of feminist studies.

INTERVIEWER:

JUDY ADAMS

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

APRIL 27, 1988

[Beginning of Audio 1]
Adams: [00:00:00] What we’re looking for is to get some background history on
either/or your connection with CROW [Center for Research On Women],
the institute; feminist studies; and as that’s related to your views on feminist
scholarship.
Keohane: Why don’t you tell me a little bit more about the project? You might not
want to use your tape on that.
[Stopped/Restarted Recording 0:00:24]
Adams: We want to go back in your own background. Maybe you could tell me a
little about when you first came to Stanford, at least to root that connection.
Keohane: Right. We first came to Stanford--we being my husband and I--in 1972 from
Swarthmore. We were actually on leave at Harvard at that point. We were
teaching in Swarthmore. We came out to be interviewed and were very
taken with the place. So we accepted jobs in the fall of 1973.
[00:00:56] Bob [Robert Keohane] came to head their international
relations program, which was just being opened, and to be a member of the
political science department. I came in a kind of peripheral capacity at first,

13

to be assistant professor but starting all over again at the bottom rung of the
ladder, even though I had already been four years an assistant professor at
Swarthmore.
We felt--and looking back I guess I still do feel, despite the problems
with starting over--that we were lucky to have two jobs in a good place
together. Once I got tenure at Stanford, we felt particularly lucky that it had
worked out that way.
When I came, I had not been doing any work in feminist political
theory at all, although fairly quickly some of those issues began to be raised.
Adams: What was your first piece of scholarship that you would say is feminist in
origin?
Keohane: [00:01:50] I didn’t really do any writing in feminism until the very end--the
late 1970s, the early 1980s. But my teaching was affected much sooner, and
my participation in the discussions at CROW, in the feminist studies origins,
and at Signs--it’s very important of course that Signs was here, too--were very
much formative in my teaching.
I was at that point working on a big book on French political thought
which was cast without any relevance at all for women, although by the time
I was finishing it that began to seem more and more strained. It would have
had to have been a completely different book to write it with a different set
of questions in mind.
Adams: So you didn’t rework that?
Keohane: No, but I dealt with it in the preface, [both laugh] and I dedicated it to my
mother for a variety of very feminist reasons. I didn’t finish that book until

14

1979. Only then did I begin to do feminist work in terms of research.
As I say, my teaching changed much earlier, and I began teaching
political theory in a different light. I began teaching the course in feminist
political theory I think by 1977 or 1978.
Adams: [00:03:03] Did you have mentors here or other scholars that you read who
influenced that development?
Keohane: Not mentors, but students and colleagues. There weren’t any mentors.
There weren’t any people ahead of us who were doing it. We were the
pioneers as far as Stanford was concerned. But there were definitely
colleagues and there were definitely graduate students who were strongly
influential. So it was our generation and the younger generation, no older
generation to look at.
Adams: How did that connection get made between graduate students and
professors? Were there formal organizations?
Keohane: At first it was more spontaneous. One of the first click experiences that I
ever had that led me to think about all this, even before I had begun to get
to know Diane [Diane Middlebrook] and Shelly [Michelle Rosaldo] and
Myra [Myra Strober] and all the others, was [with] a graduate student in the
first year or so I was at Stanford teaching Rousseau in a graduate seminar.
[00:03:59] She basically said, “How can you teach Rousseau and not
pay attention to the fifth book of Émile? Where is Sophie in all this?”
And I thought, “Sophie? What did Sophie have to do with any of
this?” But it really planted a seed. I really did think about it, and I realized I
didn’t have an answer to her question. It was an extremely good question.

15

That was the first click. I remember that very vividly.
It was about that time or a little bit later that the first messages began
coming out from the real originators, and you’ll have to talk to them. I don’t
know whether it was Estelle [Estelle Freedman], Diane, Shelly, Barbara
[Barbara Babcock] or whoever would have sent out the first notice.
But CROW had begun to get underway. It had been a year or two in
formation. They were reaching out for other people whom they thought
might be interested or interesting and said, “Why don’t you come along and
join some of these discussions?”
I said, as many other people I’m sure said, “But I’m not doing any
feminist research.”
And they said, “It doesn’t matter. You’re interested in these kinds of
questions as a person, and we want to be able to reach out and think about
what they mean with people who don’t think of themselves as doing that
kind of research.”
[00:05:06] So I came along, and then I was almost immediately really
caught up in it because it struck me as being more intellectually lively, more
a place where real questions were being asked. If no major answers were yet
being given, at least we were working toward them together in a way that
just began to make every other part of the intellectual life over the next few
years begin to seem more and more shadowy. This was really where the
exciting stuff was going on.
Adams: What were those first meetings like?

16

Keohane: Part of the problem is it’s hard in memory to separate out meetings of the
several institutions, and it’s important that they were all here--Signs, CROW,
and feminist studies. Some of the most vivid memories I have of the
meetings were of years that were more like 1977 and 1978 than the very
earliest meetings. By that time it had become central enough in my life that
the memories are made vivid both by the fact that they happened so often
and by the central things that were going on.
[00:06:06] As I remember the very early discussions, they were more
talking about people’s work, responding to papers that people had written,
which at first seemed pretty far from my field. But the people themselves
were interesting, and the discussions were interesting. My memory on all
this is very fuzzy about the really early years, but as I recall, we didn’t at first
start discussing books or concepts or projects as much as we discussed
papers that were being written by those few of us who were already selfidentified as doing feminist research.
Adams: Which would you say drew you more, if one drew you more than the other,
feminist studies or the center and its research plan as institutions, their
different roles and modes--targets, if you will?
Keohane: [00:07:00] It’s hard to make that distinction because CROW was there first,
of course, and by the time feminist studies became a real possibility on the
agenda, the overlap in membership and the overlap of people who were
engaged was so clear that it was hard to keep them separate. Only
temporarily did CROW have priority, and therefore in a sense you would
say, “Well, CROW was there first.”

17

Once feminist studies began to be a real possibility--and it was one in
which I had been involved with from the beginning--it became more
important to me institutionally because it raised issues about teaching, which
I cared greatly about, teaching at Stanford. It also raised issues about the
importance of naming in a way that I took to be a very feminist factor.
The big debate on whether to call it feminist studies or women’s
studies probably seems so odd to an outsider. Why should anybody care? It
was a major issue for us and for the university.
Adams: [00:08:08] What were the differences depicted, and how did that struggle go
forward?
Keohane: As I recall, in the early days of the program the arguments tended to be
both principled and strategic. Most of the strategic arguments were on the
side of women’s studies--that it was a less threatening term than feminist
studies, that feminist studies would be taken to be ideological as well as
harsh and scary, and that it would raise all the issues about whether we
ought to be having a program with a particular bent or commitment. It
sounded partisan to people. It sounded like we were taking one side of a
discussion instead of teaching generally.
[00:09:08] There’s something to that, but at a more fundamental level
I find it not persuasive. The arguments made sense from the way we would
be perceived by the university. Would we be accepted? Would we be taken
seriously? Would we be given a chance to grow and flourish and to attract
other adherents, or would we be seen as some kind of very strange splinter
group? In retrospect, it’s probably important, as I think about it--that we

18

were the ones who were having this discussion and we were the ones who
made the decision. Nobody came in and told us, “Sorry, for the following
reasons, you’ve got to be women’s studies or you don’t exist.” The fact that
we were being able to make the decision is probably in itself important.
[00:09:43] So the argument on the side of feminist studies was far
more that it reflected what we thought we were about, that we were
teaching a new way of envisioning traditional theory, literature, history,
which was not just an account of what women had done or might do or
would do. [It] was a real reworking of some of the traditional canons of
scholarship and the substances of their work on the basis of a criticism that
came from our feminist perceptions and commitment.
Suppose gender studies had been a possibility then. I don’t think we
would have accepted that as a serious alternative at all because it wasn’t just
that we were looking at women and men as two parallel entities which made
us reject women’s studies. [Rather,] we were assuming that we were
beginning to come to, as both political and scholarly feminists committed to
certain kinds of perceptions about the disadvantages and the oppression of
women, a fresh reading of a variety of texts, which was not captured by
calling it women’s studies.
Adams: [00:10:58] This comes later on in our conversation, but the change of the
name of CROW to the institute, if I can just ask you a small question about
that. Do you see that as a substantial change in direction relating to gender
studies now appropriate to the time?

19

Keohane: Of course I wasn’t a part of that change, and so there you’re asking for a
very different kind of statement. There I’m speaking as a more outside
observer. My first reaction was one of disappointment because I really loved
the connotations of CROW, and CROW held an awful lot of memories. It
seemed you were throwing those away unnecessarily for something else.
I guess as I understand it, there were two different kinds of reasons,
which again speaking strategically I can understand. To be an institute
carries a certain amount of weight for a variety of reasons that are to me
arcane, but I gather matter at Stanford.
[00:12:01] To bring in the notion of gender would in some way give
some of the same kinds of weight and largeness that we had hoped to give
by feminist studies rather than just women’s studies, although it does it in a
very different direction. It is true that the fields that the institute is
concerned with have generally expanded to conceive themselves as
encompassing gender issues. It has a rightness now that it would not have
had eight years ago. On balance I think it’s probably a reasonable change,
although at first I found it hard to get used to.
Adams: I’ll erase this part from the tape, but we began at one CROW meeting to
look at acronyms, and we thought IRWG [Institute for Research on Women
and Gender] wasn’t necessarily a good alternative to CROW.
Keohane: Right, or even IRWAG.
Adams: [00:12:55] Yes. How you feel about it is uncertain. When feminist studies
began, what role was planned for the relationship between CROW and

20

feminist studies, or was that at all part of the discussion--how these two
bodies would interact?
Keohane: I’m sure it was part of the discussion, and I would have to reconstruct as
carefully as I can how it went on. Again, others may be able to help you
more on that. As I recall, it was assumed that the two would continue to
have a good deal of overlap in membership and in commitment of energy,
that the center would be freed by this introduction of a new program from
one of the things that had kind of muddied the waters for its own agenda,
which was what relationship did it bear to the activities of teaching, advising
of graduate students. All this kind of things were becoming increasingly
important within the university by the very success of CROW.
[00:13:56] Yet it was not easy to explain why a research institute
should be doing these things, should be organizing courses, should be
advising students, so it made it seem easier for us to carry on parallel
enterprises with locuses or structures that were designed to be more
efficient for the doing of it. It was always assumed, I think as well, that we
would continue to be involved in each but that different people, perhaps at
different stages of their careers. would spend more time on one or the
other, and that for graduate students especially it would be important to be
involved in both because of the research emphasis of CROW.
Adams: Tell me, if you will, about how feminist studies became institutionalized, the
whole process, at least the part that you participated in and were aware--how
it began, how the germ was planted, how the committee structures aligned

21

themselves, who were the friends of feminist studies. I know you might not
be the person to answer all of these questions.
Keohane: [00:15:08] I’m not the best person to answer because my memories are not
as fresh about things like committee structures. So many committees have
overlain themselves in my mind since then.
Adams: The general feeling of how the establishment took place, were there debates
before the academic council, those kinds of questions that you were saying
the naming of the program brought to mind in the organizers?
Keohane: I don’t recall debates in the senate. That doesn’t mean there weren’t any, but
I don’t recall any. I guess I remember being rather surprised that there was
not more reaction. I suppose that’s either a good thing or a bad thing.
Adams: I was going to say that might ring a bell.
Keohane: [00:15:52] [laughs] Right. There were always people who were sort of
incensed as individuals and people like what’s his face in the French
department who would write letters to the Campus Report about how awful it
is that there should be this thing called feminist studies. That tended to be,
as I recall, a relatively idiosyncratic public face.
Now I’m sure that there were people, many people, who either didn’t
think it was important enough to spend time on or who reacted with some
of the ways we thought people might react, but didn’t, for whatever reason,
make a big deal of it.
I think it has always helped Stanford, as compared for example with
Harvard until very recently, that almost all the women who were involved in
the university in anything other than a very sort of limited “do your work

22

and go home” capacity were, by the late 1970s, involved in this in a more or
less intimate way.
[00:16:55] It would have been very difficult [to have] a sort of divideand-conquer strategy--that the women who were really part of the university
are over here and these wild-eyed feminists are over there. [That] was not
possible because all of us, with more or less intensity, were involved.
Now all of us didn’t have tenure, and for a while that was a source of
concern, although I don’t think it was as much a source of concern in
retrospect as one might think given the worry about Estelle’s tenure. None
of us who were centrally involved at that point had come up for tenure and
been denied it.
Some of us already had tenure; more of us didn’t have it yet but
didn’t have the sense that we were going to be fundamentally threatened by
our interest in feminist studies. Now you might think that was naive, but in
fact, except for Estelle’s case that proved to be true. A lot of us did get
tenure.
Adams: And still continued to be forthright, upfront feminists and feminist scholars.
Keohane: [00:17:52] Right. I think so, although you can say, “Well, you hadn’t done
any feminist research. You got your tenure on the basis of a book about
French political thought, right?” But everybody knew that my teaching
interests were increasingly in the area of feminist research and scholarship
and that my next research interests were feminist theory. I had made that
very clear. So I don’t have a sense of a set of well-defined enemies who had
a great deal of power with the university. I have more a sense of a kind of

23

bemused tolerance with people assuming that what was really important
with the university was going on somewhere else--which may be a general
problem with the humanities and the social sciences at Stanford more than a
problem with this program.
Adams: Did the program suffer from benign neglect then in any way?
Keohane: I don’t think the program itself suffered from benign neglect because we
were responsible for creating the courses, and I at least never heard of any
major opposition from within the departments about teaching the courses
we wanted to teach because Stanford is such a laissez-faire place about
teaching.
[00:18:56] CROW suffered more from the lack of resources because
there we needed to be able to reach out to bring in visiting scholars, to fund
research. There the battle for resources was much more dramatic and much
more hard-fought. But I don’t remember feminist studies [suffering]; again,
other people may remember differently.
Adams: You drew your faculty from other departments. Did the department lose
then a certain number of hours of Professor X?
Keohane: Yes, but you didn’t think of it, you see, as lose if the course was something
the department was willing to have taught, and that’s where the laissez-faireness comes in. My department was just as happy for me to teach a seminar
in feminist theory as to do a seminar in Rousseau. To them it was mox-nix.
I think that’s true of many of the departments.
Now I’m sure that’s not true of all. I’m sure there were some
students--some scholars --who faced some questioning from within their

24

departments about whether this was really the best use of their time. But I
don’t have the impression that this happened as often as you might think or
that it has happened, even at some other institutions. At Wellesley, [for
example,] I think it’s been more of a problem for people, perhaps partly
because it’s smaller, so everybody’s hours matter more.
[00:20:03] It was more that the energy and the common commitment
to feminist studies provided the power that made up for the lack of financial
resources. We gave a lot of time and energy to making it work, and the fact
that the departments for the most part didn’t begrudge the hours because
they didn’t see it as a major siphoning off meant that people didn’t seem to
be penalized or cross pressured very much in that way. Again, I’m speaking
from my own experience and my memories of others. You may find that
individual people had a harder time.
Adams: If the intention of the program was to be interdisciplinary and show the
relevance of feminist research in all the fields, was the curriculum in fact
relatively good and a representation of disciplines?
Keohane: [00:20:57] It took a while to build it, although from the beginning there were
certain disciplines that were better represented than others: anthropology,
English, history, political science. Only with time did we have sociology
represented. We never were able to get philosophy in quite the way we
wanted it, although I gather that may be changing now.
So it’s the reverse side of the problem--the advantages I’ve been
talking about [were] dependent on the people who were committed and
involved. There your issue about resources becomes relevant because we

25

didn’t have the clout or the ability to go to a department and say, “We need
somebody doing this in order to complete our feminist studies program.”
People didn’t mind if people who were already there wanted to put
[in] their time and energy, but it wasn’t important enough to any department
to go out and actually hire somebody who was going to do it. But that’s a
common problem with interdisciplinary programs, not just feminist studies.
Adams: What was your administrative--level above you that made decisions?
Programs like these are all under a provost’s office?
Keohane: [00:22:07] Yes. I guess at some point CROW reported to Jerry [Gerald]
Lieberman, who was then the research provost, and I guess feminist studies
must have reported to Herant [Herant Katchadourian], who was doing
undergraduate stuff. The question of whether we should report to Herant or
to the dean of the humanities and sciences was a big, open one. I remember
that being an argument, which other people will want to fill you in on
because I don’t remember the nuances of it.
Adams: So you didn’t have any strong views that you can recall?
Keohane: I probably did at the time, but again, so much administration has gone over
the dam since then.
Adams: Can you tell me a bit about your involvement in the program, the kind of
courses you taught, experiences you had?
Keohane: I taught the basic feminist theory courses both for undergraduates and then
eventually with a parallel graduate seminar, which was one of the few things
that was deliberately supposed to be interdisciplinary in that there’s very
little in it that was specifically political science.

26

[00:23:05] That’s because the kind of history of ideas that I do is
history of thought, and the way I taught it had probably more emphasis on
past thinkers than on contemporary feminist theory as compared to some
alternative ways of doing it. In that sense it was more consonant with what I
would have been teaching otherwise, but I certainly would not have been
teaching these people from a feminist perspective.
I found it a very enriching course to teach and often enjoyed it more
than anything else I was teaching. It became a kind of a foundation course
because it was one of the few that attempted to give some theoretical
underpinnings.
But we didn’t ever have time or skill I guess to make sure that the
theoretical underpinnings that I was giving were helpful to people who went
on to Shelly’s courses or Estelle’s courses or Diane’s courses. They had to
make the connections themselves.
Adams: [00:24:01] Did you meet in seminars?
Keohane: We continued to meet in CROW seminars, although these tended to
become less important as we had other ways of connecting and as more and
more visiting scholars were brought in. It was less important for the
continuity, for the numbers of bodies for all of us to be there, but we
continued to take part.
We also met in sort of a feminist studies governing group, but we
were meeting almost continually in the Signs collective. At this point, by the
time we had fought the fight on feminist studies and got it established and
CROW was beginning to expand, Signs was the thing that was taking up

27

most of our time. Running a journal is something you can’t just sit and
argue about and then go away and forget. You have to produce
stuff.[00:24:52] The fact that we were all engaged in these parallel,
overlapping activities meant that some of the things that we talked about
while we had our feminist studies hats on we really had in mind, “Well, how
is that going to affect this special issue of Signs,” or vice versa?
Adams:

Was that a positive impact?

Keohane: I think it was a positive impact. I think it was very healthy for us that we had
this journal partly because we had a sense from the influx of papers coming
in from all over the world of the kinds of things people were doing. And
you get it raw. You don’t just get it with the finished product.
You also get it in a multidisciplinary fashion. Since there were
relatively few of us and we were getting papers on every topic under the sun,
we all had to be assigned to read and think about papers that were far
outside our disciplines and try to think, “Who do I conceivably know who
might have something to say about this?”
It was infinitely mind-expanding to do this, and that helped us begin
to think in larger ways about what the discipline of feminist studies itself
might be. I think it would have been a much impoverished experience if it
hadn’t been for Signs, and it came at just the right time.
Adams: [00:26:01] How did that connection get made? I know it’s a rotating
situation, but how was it [done]?
Keohane: When Catharine Stimpson, the founding editor, stepped down or was about
to step down and wanted to have the experience of having it be run by a

28

group of scholars together in a university that was large enough to sustain it,
there were only a few places in the country for which that could be true. It
was known that there was an opportunity now to bid for Signs. I can’t even
remember whose idea it was, but somebody had the idea that we should
make a bid for it, that we could do it ourselves.
Adams: Now did you say, “Whoa, this is too much we’re trying to do”?
Keohane: No, I think we were all very excited about it. I remember those meetings
more vividly than the other meetings because it was kind of scary, what we
were taking on. I remember sitting around--it must have been either a
feminist studies meeting or a CROW meeting--and somebody just
brainstorming and saying, “You know, this is possible. Signs is coming up
for grabs. Wouldn’t it make a big difference to us to have this journal?”
[00:27:03] And people saying, “Gulp,” but then saying, “Sure, it
would,” in the same meeting. It wasn’t as though we all went off and
thought about it for six months. We all decided it was worth doing, and we
convinced Barbara, who was at that point more peripheral in her
department and had some skill as an editor, that she could be the editor of
Signs and we would all support her. We would all be her collective and we
would all do it together. It seems in retrospect as bold as it could be to think
we could take on a journal. We knew nothing about running a journal, but it
was very important that we did.
Adams: Who was at that time the primary leader, if you will, of feminist studies?
Keohane: Shelly. Shelly and Diane.
Adams: And your involvement was core but not super decisive?

29

Keohane: Well, I don’t know. Somebody else might say I was at that level. I don’t
know, it’s hard for me to judge. I was certainly part of the four or five.
Adams: Was it truly a collective kind of [action]?
Keohane: [00:27:56] It was truly a collective. It was wonderful. That’s why it’s hard to
say there was a leader. I name Shelly and Diane because of the force of their
personalities, but they weren’t leaders of the rest of us. They didn’t order us
around or tell us what to do or send us reminder notes. Diane’s not as
organized as I am.
It was very much a collective, and the only reason I name them as the
leaders is because of the force of their personality and the force of their
intellect. It was one of the best examples that I know of--the best in my
personal experience, of what feminist cooperation was like at the best stage
of the 1970s, was what Signs was like.
Adams: What was your first issue, and how did you determine the subject of that?
Keohane: For one thing we found that we had papers left over that we didn’t know we
had to do something with. So our grandiose notion to start afresh was
crippled by the reality that there were papers that Kate had committed to
publishing, which we had now to take on and only gradually could we begin
to decide our own things.
[00:29:08] We didn’t do many special issues at the very beginning
because we were such an eclectic group and we were so interested in the
wealth of things that were being sent to us. It seemed premature
immediately to say, “This is what we want to impose.”
I remember long discussions about “Women and Work” early on,

30

and I remember early on the discussions about the “Communities of
Women” issue, which only actually came into being relatively late in the
period. We talked about it from the very beginning and wanted to do such
an issue, but it was hard to know where the papers were going to come
from. They weren’t coming in over the transom, whereas some [were
promised].
Adams: Did you solicit any?
Keohane: We finally did a conference. We did a whole conference.
Adams: Was that a CROW-sponsored conference?
Keohane: [00:29:58] [both laugh] I don’t remember that because these things were all
together. Somebody sponsored it. Somebody got money for it, and it was
expected that the papers would be published in Signs. We did that because
we weren’t getting the papers that we wanted. We knew this topic needed to
be addressed and we kept coming back to it over the years. [We] said finally,
“We’re going to have to do it ourselves.”
Those are the two special issues that I remember most vividly. The
one that it was clear to us that it needed to be addressed and we were
getting papers we wanted to fit together, the “Women and Violence” issue,
which again came relatively late [and] was more like the “Work” issue. We
were getting the papers. We knew it was a big topic. We wanted to have a
way to crystallize them.

[Beginning of Audio 2]

31

Adams: [00:00:00] Now the issue on “Women and Violence.” One of the first
conferences that Marilyn [Marilyn Yalom] did at CROW was on domestic
violence. Who were others involved in contributing to Signs on your
editorial? You must have had an informal network of reading papers or did
you just stay within your editorial collective?
Keohane: We mostly stayed within our editorial collective and then branched out to a
much larger group, not all of whom were geographically at Stanford. Almost
everybody who was centrally involved was part of the collective, and then
we would call on other people at Stanford. We would also call on other
people at Berkeley or at Columbia or wherever.
[00:00:56] It wasn’t so much that it was a set of concentric circles. On
that issue there was the collective and then there was a lot of other people.
It was geographically easier to pick up the phone and call somebody at
Stanford, but we didn’t want to impose on other people.
Adams: Was that a model that other universities that had Signs maintained?
Keohane: I don’t know. It had only been done once before. Do you mean since?
Adams: After, yes.
Keohane: I’m not sure, because again I had left before the transition was made, and I
heard rumors about some difficulties in the transition. I gather the people at
Stanford wanted to be sure to keep Signs, but the person that they wanted to
have be editor was not a tenured member of the faculty.
The University of Chicago Press, inspired by whom I do not know,
indicated that that really wasn’t sufficient, that we wanted a central tenured
leader. Whether that was a reaction on their part to the sense of our

32

collectivity and they wanted somebody who would be more like Kate
Stimpson I don’t know, although we certainly never had the impression they
weren’t quite satisfied with what we were doing.
Adams: [00:02:03] Was there ever any idea of starting a Stanford journal?
Keohane: Not that I recall.
Adams: Way back in CROW when I was first starting to work at Stanford, which
was about 1976, CROW, and it may have been the Graduate Women’s
Network or the beginnings of that, had a little magazine, S/E. I don’t know
if you remember that. It was very light.
Keohane: Yes, I do remember it. I had forgotten it.
Adams: It was not a heavyweight feminist scholarship magazine, but it had some
columns and articles in it.
Tell me a little bit about the graduate students or students that you
worked with and how you felt they were absorbing [the ideas.] Did you get
students who were already full-blown feminists?
Keohane: [00:02:51] By the end of the period we did, yes. I was thinking about Mary
Klages, who I understand is still here, and her work on pyro-feminism. It
seems so far from Loraine in 1974 asking me why I wasn’t teaching Sophie,
and Mary in 1979, bursting on the scene with pyro-feminism. It was a
measure of how far we’d come.
Adams: You might want to define “pyro-feminism” for history.
Keohane: Well, she was thinking about the burning aspects of some feminist writers
such as Virginia Woolf and Three Guineas with all the burning imagery--tear
the house down. None of this mealy-mouth, middle-of-the-road-edness, but

33

really radical feminism with a particular edge. Not militant, but just literary
irony--commitment.
Part of the problem that I had was that there was nobody the whole
time I was here who came to do feminist political theory, because people
didn’t tend to come to Stanford to do political theory, with very few
exceptions. It was not known as a place where there was a great deal of
depth in the teaching of it.
[00:04:06] I didn’t have graduate students as Diane did or Estelle did
or Shelly did or Jane [Jane Collier] who came to Stanford to work with
them, who came as feminists in their field. But I did work with several of
those people whose projects turned out to be theoretical in a way that my
own training could help.
I sat on committees for several theses in anthropology and one in
history and so forth, and a lot of these people came to my graduate seminar.
It was through the graduate seminar that I was most able to have a sense of
these graduate students as coworkers rather than through their theses or
through other courses they would be taking in the department or anything.
Adams: Have you been following the debate on western culture at Stanford?
Keohane: Sure, yes.
Adams: Do you have any comments on its outcome as an observer?
Keohane: [00:05:02] Well, I have to declare my interest because I was part of the
original committee that set up the western culture program back in 1980.
On that ground, I guess I’m pretty satisfied with the outcome because the
kinds of things we were trying to do back then. I think John Perry and

34

Carolyn Lougee [Carolyn Lougee Chappell] expressed opinions that are
closest to the ones I would have expressed if I had been taking part in the
debate.
We never intended it to be a straitjacket. We never intended it to be
something that people would feel they were rigidly compelled to teach. Also,
ever since that discussion, I have become more and more convinced that
there’s no way you can define a single canon, and that for somebody to read
some of the great works of western culture. Knowing that nobody can read
all, and then also to have a chance to see them in the light of other kinds of
works, such as reading Genesis and a Yoruba creation myth or something, I
think is much better than just reading Genesis.
[00:05:59] Or reading Virginia Woolf is wonderful, but not just
plugging Virginia Woolf in, but also thinking about comments and criticisms
that a feminist or a socialist or a black perspective would bring makes it
much richer.
Basically I think it’s a good outcome. I do hope there will continue to
be a sustained attention to the works of western culture because I think
people are impoverished in their ability to understand or criticize if they
don’t know them. I think it would be a shame not to have them. I don’t see
the present decision as a major step away from that. I just see it as an
attempt to keep that impulse alive in a way that makes people now want to
study it and work in it rather than having it become a dead end. I think it
was a good outcome, and I think the amount of time people spent

35

discussing it, really giving it serious attention rather than just brushing it off,
is very much to Stanford’s credit.
Adams: [00:07:04] When you began to hear the clicks of feminist concerns making
sense in your scholarship, there were obviously many of your colleagues
here and at other universities who didn’t hear those clicks and didn’t change
their approach. Do you have any ideas on what makes for a receptive
attitude? This can be personal or intellectual.
Keohane: I think it depends on what stage in history you’re talking about, to some
extent. For people who experienced those flashes of insight in the early
1970s, my hunch is that it would normally have been on the basis of some
personal readiness created by the kinds of experiences one had had. [These
experiences] would lead one to be ready to read the classics of one’s
scholarship in a new light because it began to make sense of something or
to raise questions about something. It would have been from the personal
experience that the impulse to begin to take these questions seriously would
have come.
[00:08:24] And then because one dislikes the cognitive dissonance of
having one’s professional life and one’s personal life off in separate
compartments, it leads you to want to raise the same kinds of questions
through your work, particularly if you’re in something like political theory or
anthropology where the transitions are relatively easily made. It would have
been harder I guess even now, but certainly then, for a biologist or a
physicist. Although people are doing it, it would have been harder.
[00:08:51] For the 1970s, my hunch is that it was primarily personal,

36

maybe because the professional reasons didn’t exist until some people had
begun to make the connections and therefore produce the scholarship. Now
it seems to me it’s more likely that people could be persuaded by the
excitement and the excellence of the scholarship in certain fields at least.
Adams: It’s less of a limb to climb out on.
Keohane: Yes, that’s right, but could be intrigued by it and then maybe make some of
the personal connection. And [for] men as well as women I think it can
happen now, almost twenty years [later[--the reverse of the way it happened
to those of us in the 1970s.
Adams: Is that the way it happened for you?
Keohane: The personal way? Oh, yes.
Adams: Do you want to elaborate on that?
Keohane: I guess the most relevant parts of things were my first teaching experience at
Swarthmore when I was very much a peripheral member of the department,
partly by my own choice. I found it very frustrating and very hard to be
treated in retrospect as I realized in ways which no man scholar would ever
have accepted. It was all part of the way we were partially fitted into the
academy.
[00:10:10] Only at the very end of my time at Swarthmore in 1970 did
a bunch of us women get together and begin comparing notes about the
way Swarthmore had been treating us and realized that this lovely, cozy,
little, happy, intellectual place had some real patterns of discrimination. We
began to talk about what was happening to us. And there were some
students at Yale--some women students at Yale who were doing a study

37

about the career patterns of the women who graduated from Yale between
1965 and 1980 as graduate students. In answering their questionnaire and
reflecting on their questions, I remember trying to make it very clear that
the kinds of patterns I was finding for them--which I’m sure they will find
with others--were not nearly so much imposed on us as a kind of conspiracy
theory might guess, I was very much complicit in what was happening.
[00:11:12] I really thought of myself as having a career that was less
important than my husband’s, and when I chose to take a minor job in
order to make it possible for him to take a real job, it never occurred to us
that anybody would do anything else.
It wasn’t as though Yale shunted me off into a minor job. Yale made
it possible for me to have a couple of very good offers. Nobody broke their
backs to get them for me, but they didn’t discourage me from looking and
they didn’t write recommendations that meant I didn’t get them.
Nobody just brought me up short and said, “Wait a minute, why are
you taking this hunky-dory job as a flunky at Swarthmore when you’ve got
an offer of a tenure-track at Yale and UNC? What are you doing?” Nobody
said that because it was assumed that I would go with my husband.
[00:11:55] It’s not totally fair to blame Yale. One blames the times.
But then all those experiences, which I just accepted and floated through
until 1970, were very much in my mind and beginning to come to a head
when I came to Stanford. That’s why I was ripe material.
Adams: When you came to Stanford, was it in that sort of secondary [role]?

38

Keohane: It was at first, although it was relatively quickly wiped away at Stanford. It
was very much at first that I was coming. It was pretty clear because people
really wanted Bob. I had published a couple of things, and I had a
reputation as a very good teacher.
They had an open slot in political theory, but everybody sort of felt I
was backing into it because they hadn’t done a search and all this stuff. By
the time I’d been here a few years and proved that I was a real scholar and
would be able to sustain my strength in an open search, a lot of that
dropped away. But it was very much there when I came.
Adams: [00:12:56] What do you see as you now observe graduate students
developing? Are they starting ten steps ahead in the 1980s, or do you see
some of the same kinds of attitudes?
Keohane: You have to remember, I haven’t taught graduate students for seven years
now, and so I’m speaking about what I see from the other side of a college
hiring new professors. From that side, it seems to me if anything, there are
no disabilities in [women] being hired, and there’s a very strong wish to hire
strong women and minorities. We’re talking about women, definitely
women.
We find ourselves at Wellesley competing much harder for the
strong, young women in every field who in the past would have come to
Wellesley because nobody else was bright enough to see how good they
were. Now we find ourselves having to make sure we maintain our sex ratio
with enough women, which is an amazing thought.
[00:13:57] So the graduate students are being hired. Whether they are

39

being taken seriously as scholars in other ways--being given the mentoring,
being given the support, being given a chance to do the kinds of things that
will bring them through their fields to success tenure decisions--there I
think ten steps puts it too strongly.
Here’s a place where my husband as a graduate advisor at Harvard
and Brandeis has given me some very interesting insights as his own
consciousness develops on this about how a number of his colleagues, who
probably think of themselves as being very open on all these issues.
Nonetheless [they] unconsciously treat women differently from men in little
things like worrying about slapping a woman on the back, inviting her out
for a drink, being really critical of her paper, for being accused of sexual
harassment or sexual discrimination or something. So [they] treat women in
a different category without consciously discriminating against them at all.
We all know how that changes the way you feel about yourself and your
chances in the field. I think all those things are still going on.
[00:15:06] But that doesn’t mean women don’t get good jobs. It
means it’s harder to have that reservoir of self-confidence and sense of
direction that comes from having the mentoring, serious criticism, the
nagging support.
Adams: How have you and your husband supported each other intellectually and
emotionally in your relationship to your professional work? How has that
interaction developed over time?
Keohane: It’s been very important. I’m sure it’s developed, too, although that’s a
different story, [laughs] and that’s a long story. It’s been very important at

40

every stage. Bob has always been very interested in these things, although he
would be the first to say his own consciousness has risen, too.
[00:15:54] It was he at first at Swarthmore who was enraged by the
fact that I was not invited as a member of the social sciences to the
longstanding Wednesday evening seminar there where everybody presented
their work. There had never been a woman member, and always the
argument was that women were part-time or they were something else. Only
fulltime people came or whatever. Bob was enraged by this, and so he
launched a campaign to get me admitted to [social sciences faculty], which
he did.
Adams: What was the name of it?
Keohane: Social Science Faculty--SoSciFac.
I was upset, but I didn’t know how on earth I would fight it and I didn’t
really feel like making a big issue of it. He was the one who insisted that we
make an issue of it. So it’s not as though he’s only gradually come to
consciousness. Our consciousness has grown in tandem dialectically on each
other, and he’s been tremendously supportive at all stages.
Adams: Coming back to Stanford, has it been a strange journey in time to see what
feminist studies is doing now? Are you surprised by some developments?
Keohane: [00:17:02] No, I think it’s very heartening. I was depressed, as everybody
was, at the sense of malaise in the very early 1980s when Shelly died, Estelle
didn’t get tenure, and I left. Everybody was saying, “The old order is
changing, and what’s going to take its place?”
But I was wonderfully heartened on coming back to find that the old

41

core had regrouped and had multiplied itself. There are all these wonderful
people, both graduate students and faculty members, who are closely
involved in both feminist studies and IRWG. A lot of good, new people like
Regenia Gagnier and a lot of other people have come who are bringing all
the kinds of commitments and sharp-edged focuses and everything that one
would want. So it turned out to have been a setback, but not a crucial
lowering of possibilities. If anything, I think things are stronger now than
they were.
[00:18:11] There will inevitably be some nostalgia in all of us about
those early days and how they felt. I don’t think anybody could ever
recapture them, but then you don’t. You go on and do something else. I
think what they’re doing now is at least as strong and at least as efficient and
effective as what we were doing. It’s a little different but it’s got the same
basic aims and spirit, and I think that’s very heartening.
Adams: In those early days, how much was there a connection among other
universities that had similar programs and professional associations?
Keohane: Relatively little.
Adams: Conferences?
Keohane: There was a women’s studies association, but I think the first conference of
women’s studies was in 1979. You can find this out. It was not until
relatively late in the period that we had a sense that there were other people
doing these things.
[00:19:03] One exception to that was Berkeley. There was a strong
group of people doing women’s studies at Berkeley, which must have pulled

42

together in I don’t know exactly when. By the end of the period, a bunch of
us were driving up there every month or so to take part in discussions of
women’s studies at Berkeley.
Adams: Do you remember any of the faculty?
Keohane: I remember Gloria Bowles was very much involved, and Judith [Judith
Newton], who was at Davis. I should be remembering more of the names
than I am. It brought people from Davis, mostly who lived in Berkeley,
even some people from Santa Cruz, those of us from Stanford and the
Berkeley people, and some people from San Francisco.
That was good. That was the first sense that there was a Bay Area
collective on this. Beyond that, I at least didn’t have much sense because I
was still more embedded in my own discipline and trying to bring some of
these feminist connections in. [I was] making connections with people
within political science who were asking feminist questions rather than
seeing myself as a women’s studies person.
Adams: [00:20:12] How much did you succeed in that bringing together within your
own department?
Keohane: Not in my own department, but within the discipline as a whole within the
fellowship of people who do political theory. It wasn’t so much that I
succeeded in bringing the light, it’s that I was reaching out to other people
who were beginning to do the same things. We found a network in which
we could criticize each other and read each other’s work.
Adams: What would you say was your first piece of feminist scholarship?

43

Keohane: The essay for Ethics called “Feminist Scholarship and Human Nature,”
which was a review essay of several very disparate works in feminist
research and philosophy in which I had a final section; I tried to meditate
about some of the larger issues that were raised. It was the first thing that
was published.
[00:21:08] I don’t know whether that predated a talk that I gave at
Vanderbilt in a conference on women’s studies, which then became an essay
called “Speaking from Silence: Women and the Science of Politics,” which
was published after the Ethics thing. I think [the talk] was probably given
first. Those are the only two things I really had a chance to publish before I
left to become an administrator.
One of the few real disappointments was [with] the special issue of
Signs on feminist theory--which Shelly, Barbara and I had been so excited
about and worked so hard to pull the papers together. We had been going to
write the most incredible introduction to that volume, we had begun to have
some ideas for it, and then came that awful summer when Shelly died and I
had left. That introduction now exists as a shadow of what it would have
been--that was disappointing.
Adams: [00:22:03] Have you reworked that any?
Keohane: No, I’ve gone on to other things, but I haven’t had a chance to rework that.
Maybe someday, although it’s a little bit painful to go back to because it
reminds me too much of Shelly. [laughs]

44

Adams: This is somewhat of an aside from more institutional history here, but
presidential politics and feminist political theory, are those two
contradictory?
Keohane: You mean American presidential politics?
Adams: American presidential politics. Do you see any impact on the way things are
done and the way you observe as a political theorist and feminist?
Keohane: You mean whether people are running different campaigns or what?
Adams: I mean running different campaigns different ways, the involvement of
women in politics, the involvement of feminist issues, feminist men or
women.
Keohane: [00:22:58] Clearly the emerging sense that child care is a major issue has a lot
to do with the feminist agenda. I don’t think it would have come without it.
Individual people like Pat Schroeder or Madeleine Kunin in Vermont,
Claudine Schneider, are clearly making a difference in the kinds of issues
that they raise. Because they are treated seriously, because they’ve worked
their way up through the ranks by some of the same rules [they] are able to
direct the attention of their colleagues to some things that otherwise would
have been regarded as peripheral.
Susan Estrich, who was managing Michael Dukakis’ campaign, is a
Wellesley alumna and a feminist. I can’t imagine that that doesn’t have some
spillover in the way she runs the campaign even though a campaign has
certain rigorous requirements. You can only vary so much if you’re going to
have a successful campaign, but the fact that she’s there is itself a step
forward.

45

Adams: [00:24:00] Do you miss some of the direct give-and-take of teaching as an
administrator?
Keohane: Oh, sure. All the time.
Adams: What are your plans for the future?
Keohane: Well, I’m going to go back to Wellesley and finish the job in terms of things
like programs that we’re setting up and a capital campaign that we’re just
launching, because there’s too much invested in that to leave it in the
middle. I really don’t want to, even though I do miss teaching and research.
I really want to go back and finish the job.
At the end of that time, I am not at all sure what I want to do. If you
ask me right now, my hunch is I want to go back to being a scholar. I’ve
really enjoyed this year a lot, and I’m not sorry I’ve had the chance to be an
administrator. I’ve learned a lot about it and by it. This is all coming out in a
profile in Campus Report.
Adams: Yes, I picked up Campus Report. I didn’t get a chance to read it.
Keohane: Is it in? I don’t know that it’s in this week’s. It’s coming out.
Adams: [00:25:00] I looked through--my housemate does the paystub for Campus
Report, and she said, “Oh, there’s an article that I should have xeroxed for
you.”
Keohane: It was a different kind of set of questions, but now we’re getting onto that
terrain.
Adams: I didn’t want to cover that period.
Keohane: It sounds like a very important project you’re launched on.

46

Adams: Are there things that I didn’t ask that if you had a chance to think before I
came?
Keohane: No. I guess I would close by emphasizing the uniquely important intellectual
intensity and sisterhood of those last years of the 1970s. Other people can
tell you about the administrative structure, who supported whom, and who
were our enemies and who weren’t. All of those things I’m sure can be
reconstructed.
[00:25:50] The thing that shouldn’t be lost is how important it was to
all of us personally that our professional lives, our friendships, our support
for each other were all being fused into this collective endeavor with, by that
time, Signs at the heart, with feminist studies almost inextricably involved
and CROW always there as the oldest and in some ways the supportive
structure, and how they all kind of melded into each other.
In trying to describe what it felt with specific places in mind, if I were
a novelist I would describe them better than I can. But sitting around a low
table in Shelly Rosaldo’s big house on Embarcadero, beginning in the
middle of a sunny afternoon and extending way into the night, talking about
special issues of Signs, all of us sitting around, all of us by then knowing each
other very well and being very comfortable with our discussions, some
things not even needing to be said.
[00:26:47] Or in the backyard of Margery Wolf’s house on Campus
Drive the last summer we were all working together, looking ahead, looking
back, thinking about what we’d done, going for a swim, coming back and
starting again. There was a kind of a joining together of minds and emotions

47

and aims and languages, ambitions for the future, optimism, but also a
certain degree of playful humor about the obstacles we faced, which really
was extraordinary. So that has to be captured, too. [laughs]
