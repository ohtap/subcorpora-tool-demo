ALUMNI STORIES, CLASS OF 1958

INTERVIEWER: TRUDY REINHARDT
SUBJECT: KAY ISABEL FELDSMITH BUSHNELL
DATE: 9 OCTOBER 2008
Reinhardt: This is Trudy Reinhardt and I’m interviewing Kay Bushnell on Thursday
October the 9th, 2008. So let’s just start with: where did you live when you were on
campus?
Bushnell: I lived at Roble Hall, which was one of the two freshmen dorms for
women at that time. And we had a triplet. There was a room in the middle and two small
rooms on each side. And so we, instead of having two people, which I think they were
originally designed for, we had three, one in each of those rooms. And, of course, the
middle person had someone walking through their room almost all the time. So, it was a
nice arrangement though.
Reinhardt: How did you first meet your roommates?
Bushnell: We just came and it was all assigned, pre-assigned. One was from Seattle,
and one was from San Diego, and I was from San Jose which—but it was very exciting.
We were all very different but we got along fine, although we didn’t room together after
that. But we got along fine the first year.
Reinhardt:

And ultimately, what did you major in? What brought you to that?

Bushnell:
Well, I majored in Spanish. And eventually I got my Master’s in
Education. And it was a very, it was a good major. I don’t think I’d major in it again.
But I think it was good at the time, and I enjoyed it and had a lot of fun, and met some
wonderful professors.
Reinhardt:

Any particular ones that stand out in your mind?

Bushnell: Oh yes. Oh yes. I can talk about a couple of them that really stood out.
Because I was a Spanish major, I took a lot of courses in Hispanic American Studies
which, you know -- the news of what was going on in Hispanic America, Central
America, Latin America. And one of the outstanding professors in that area, of course,
was Ronald Hilton. [[HILTON, RONALD, Professor of Romanic Languages. B.A.,
Oxford, 1933, M.A., 1936. At Stanford since 1942] You probably have heard of him.
He’s a most amazing man; extremely brilliant. He could switch from one language to
another with the greatest of ease, which just impressed me no end. He was very talented.
He had a very strong personality. And one of the things -- I know I learned a lot of
subject matter from him, but one of the things I most remember is that he had certain
things that he liked students to do, and certain things he did not like students to do. And

2

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

one of the things, or some of the things he didn’t like students to do was chewing gum, or
getting to class late. And I had a class where it was Tuesday and Thursday I think at 8.
And students who came late—this was at Engineering Corner -- and if students came
late—the door was shut at 8 o’clock or shortly thereafter, and anybody who came late
usually would bang on the door, rap on the window, looking in and seeing all the other
students in there. But he would go on lecturing as if they didn’t exist. So they did not
have the opportunity to participate in that particular class. But I assume that they learned
to come earlier if they wanted to hear Dr. Hilton speak. But he also had another thing that
he didn’t like, which was chewing gum and he made anybody who was chewing gum
come down in front of the class, take the gum out and deposit it in the wastebasket in
front of the whole class. But that was very exciting. It spiced up my studies of Hispanic
America.
He also liked Dymo labels. He had a Hispanic American Studies house on the Row
named Bolivar House and it was a very, it was a fun place actually. We had lots and lots
of interesting guests. And he had Dymo labels -- those little labels, you know, that you
make with a Dymo labeler -- and he had them all over the place. So he knew what
everything was for and where things should go. Everything was very organized. But he
did have some exciting guests that came to Bolivar House. One of them was Sir Harold
Mitchell. [Harold Paton Mitchell, British politician and businesman, 1900-1983] I don’t
know how he knew Sir Harold but when Sir Harold came, there was always a flurry of
excitement. Sir Harold lived, I think, in Dos Rios, Jamaica. And I just don’t know his
background, but he seemed to have a colorful background, and Professor Hilton
obviously respected him a great deal. And we also had people such as Burnett Bolloten
[1909-1987] who wrote The Grand Camouflage which was a very important book on the
Spanish Civil War. Of course, Professor Hilton had also been a journalist during the
Spanish Civil War, and perhaps he knew Burnett Bolloten from those times. I don’t know
for sure how he knew him. But it was very exciting to have such a knowledgeable person
associated with Bolivar House, as I believe he gave lectures, and generally he was a
presence around Bolivar House at the time I was there.
And we also published the Hispanic American Report, which was, I believe it was a
monthly. And in order to publish—it was all the contemporary news -- and so we
received newspapers from all over Latin America and we each had a country. My
country was Brazil, and other people had Venezuela and so on. And we would cut out,
we would read the papers and we would cut out articles of interest. And then we would
take all these articles and somehow assemble the latest news from that country. And it
was very interesting. You really, really learned a lot. And, of course, you had to read in
the language of your country which would either be Spanish or Portuguese, and
Portuguese in my case. But that was very exciting. Another thing that I found very
interesting was that when I was an undergraduate here, I graduated in 1958 and I came
back in 1961 and I got a Master’s in Hispanic American Studies, but the atmosphere had
changed. You know, Fidel Castro’s revolution had occurred from the time I was an
undergraduate and the time I came back. So it was a very exciting time. We had some
undergraduates who dressed in the manner of a revolutionary, which was the first time I
had seen any kind of political manifestation among the students at Stanford. To see these

3

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

students with their berets and intent looks, you know, obviously interested in showing
interest in the revolution in Cuba.
But I really admired Professor Hilton. He was such an intelligent man, a colorful man, a
strong man and his—Mrs. Hilton used to have wonderful, wonderful get-togethers at their
lovely home up in Santa Ynez [766 Santa Ynez] on the campus. And she was a very
good cook and she had wonderful, wonderful dinners and get-togethers for the people
who worked on the Hispanic American Report. I had other wonderful professors and
memories just that stand out in my mind. One was Professor Du Shane [DU SHANE,
GRAHAM PHILLIPS, Professor of Biology. B.A., Wabash, 1930; Ph.D., Yale, 1934. At Stanford, 1935-36,
1943 and since 1946] who taught freshman biology. He was the lecturer. This was not the

section. This was the big class. It was held at Mem Aud [Memorial Auditorium]. And
we had two: Professor Regnery [REGNERY, DAVID COOK, Associate Professor of Biology. A.B.,
Stanford, 1941; Ph.D., California Inst. Of Tech., 1947. At Stanford since 1947] sometimes lectured
and Professor Du Shane sometimes lectured. But I believe it was Du Shane was
ambidextrous. He could draw with both his hands. And he used a lot of different colored
chalk. So what you’d see on the board, he’d draw these cells and all the parts of the cell,
but he’d do it with both hands and different colors, very quickly. And he drew so
quickly. I don’t know how the man could do anything so quickly. It was just, you almost
were overwhelmed by the speed at which he drew and the precision at which he drew too.
Another professor that stands out in my mind is Professor Rael [RAEL, JUAN B.,
Professor of Spanish. A.B., St. Mary's, 1923; A.M., California, 1927; Ph.D., Stanford,
1937. At Stanford since 1934] and his wife, Mrs. Rael, I believe her name was Quirina
Rael; and just very, very warm and charming people. He also—Professor Rael held a
summer school in coordination with another professor from, I think it was Professor
Rosaldo from University of Arizona.[Renato I. Rosaldo, 1912-1992. Father of Stanford
anthropologist Renato Rosaldo Jr.] And the two of them sponsored this summer school
in Guadalajara, Mexico. And so one summer I went down there, I believe it was after my
sophomore year, and then you lived with a Mexican family in Guadalajara, and that was a
wonderful experience. And, of course, it was very well run by Professor Rael. He was
just, you know, a very, very careful, very caring and very organized professor, person.
And then another class I very much remember is art history with Professor Farmer.
[FARMER, EDWARD McNEIL, Professor of Art. A.B.,Stanford, 1923, A.M., 1926. At
Stanford since 1923.] Professor Farmer was just—he made things come alive. He would
just—the pictures he showed and the slides he showed of art were just amazing. And I
mean, he gave little sayings to help us remember such as, I think it was “Hadley Hall,
more glass than wall.” So if I ever, whenever I think of Hadley Hall, and I think it was
Hadley Hall, I think ‘more glass than wall.’ So he was a very, very, very interesting and
memorable professor.
I also took some classes that I would never have taken otherwise if I had gone somewhere
else, such as horseback riding only they called it equitation. And equitation, I think it
was 1958 or maybe it was ’57, consisted of going to the Stanford barn and saddling up,
and it was an English saddle and I wasn’t used to riding English style. We didn’t wear
any helmets. We just got on our horses and our teacher was, I believe was either Russian
or Polish, Colonel somebody. [Alexande P. Sysin, 1892-1976] And I think his
4

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

background was that he was in the Czar’s army or the Polish army; anyway, some
European army at one time, obviously the cavalry. And he would give orders. He was
very strict, and we did exactly what he said; and he would ride behind us shouting these
orders, telling us to do this and that and whatever. And, of course, with the English
saddle, you have to—you don’t have any horn; it’s not like the Western where you can
hold onto something. You’re supposed to hold on with your knees. And that was kind of
a problem because my knees got very, very raw from trying to hold onto the saddle. I
had really bad saddle burns that actually lasted; the scars lasted for a number of years
afterwards. But we would canter across the fields where you have the Medical Center
now and you have the Classic Residences of Hyatt. Well, in those days, there was
nothing there. It was just fields. And we had the old eucalyptus trees that parallel, lines
of eucalyptus trees which, in the old days, the Stanford home, I believe, the carriages
would go between these trees out to the Stanford home which was out near the creek.
[Note: Gum Tree Lane, later known as Governor’s Avenue, from the Stanford home to
Lake Lagunita and the Stanford Barn] We would go through these trees. We would
canter through the trees with the colonel not far behind us, giving us orders. And it was
quite an experience. I remember that very distinctly. I also took ice skating at Stanford.
There was an ice skating rink in Palo Alto, and Stanford had arranged for its students to
take ice skating. So that’s where I learned to ice skate. And bowling: that’s another
thing I took at Stanford and we didn’t have bowling places on campus at the time. We
had to go to Palo Alto Bowl. So we all drove in and, you know, we carpooled into Palo
Alto and took our bowling classes and that’s how I learned to bowl. Later they had a
bowling rink on campus [in Tresidder Union].
Reinhardt:

Oh really?

Bushnell:
Uh huh. I think it was taken out and I don’t know what—there’s
something else is there now. And I also remember my folk dancing classes which I really
enjoyed. And archery; oh yes, I took archery. I remember that now. And I never would
have taken archery anywhere else I’m sure. But those all were such fun.
Reinhardt: Were those classes optional or did you have to take a certain number of
sort of sport type of…
Bushnell:
I think when I was a freshman and sophomore, we had to take some kind
of physical education. But as a junior or senior, I think they were optional, and I took
them probably as optional courses. But it was so much and I have some great memories
of those.
Reinhardt:
Spanish?

Circling back, I was wondering what made you decide to major in

Bushnell:
Well I found it interesting; I always liked languages, and I had taken some
of it in high school. I also took French in high school and I liked French; I took a lot of
French. I just liked it, and it was easy for me, and I liked the idea of being able to
communicate with people that I wouldn’t be able to communicate [with] otherwise. And

5

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

I’ve used it a lot. It’s been a very practical major since we have so many Spanish
speaking people here in California. But I did a lot of other fun things at Stanford besides
take courses.
Reinhardt: Well, that’s important. I want to ask you about your activities that were
maybe non-academic but…
Bushnell:
Yeah, oh we have—we had so much fun. When I was a freshman, I tried
out for Big Game Gaieties. I thought it would be fun to be in, and tried out with—the
person who was in charge of deciding whether I would be in or out was a person named
Warner LeRoy [Warner Lewis LeRoy, BA, Drama 1956] who happened to be the son of, I
believe he was the son of Mervyn LeRoy [1900-1987] who was a big Hollywood
producer. So I didn’t realize that at the time, and I had never done any dancing or
anything, but I thought at freshman bravado, I thought I could some dancing. So I tried
out, and they said “Oh, do the grapevine.” Well, I didn’t know what the grapevine was,
but I watched other people do it and I stumbled through it. Anyway, I got into Gaieties,
but the downside is that I realized how much time it was going to take, and I didn’t want
to get bad grades my first quarter at Stanford, so I decided not to do it. But I’ve always
kind of regretted that I didn’t do it now.
And I was also in the Student Guide Service. The Student Guide Service took people all
around campus, mostly the Church and the Hoover Tower. And we’d take people up in
the Hoover Tower. We’d get them into the elevator and push the button and then we’d
go all the way up. And then we went to the top, and then I’d stand there and point out all
the different, you know, scenes at Stanford. And in the Church, the same thing: give
them the—this was before we had the earthquake damage of 1989. And I had a very
exciting experience as a student guide. And I believe it was 1958; it might have been ’57
but I think it was ’58, and I think it was spring quarter. We were at the top of the tower
and I had a small group of people, and I was telling them about different things and we
had an earthquake. So the tower, I believe, must be built to sway, because it definitely
swayed and we started to slip a little bit back and forth. And it was very exciting. You
know, everybody got quite excited but there was nothing we could do, because this is a
very slow elevator and to get down we had have to -- number one, I’d have to push the
button which everybody else in Hoover Tower was using for all those offices and things.
And then we’d have to take our slow ride down to the bottom. Well, I did push the
button and eventually it came, and by that time, the earthquake had subsided but it was a
pretty nerve-wracking thing for a few minutes. We were wondering just how bad this
was going to get. We actually slipped around a bit and kind of, you know, went back and
forth. And then when we got down to the bottom, the door opened and all the people on
the ground floor had gathered to see who was there, who was up at the tower and were
we okay. So we had quite a group meeting us when the doors opened. But that was a
very exciting and memorable event for me.
Reinhardt:
to…

What was the view like at the [time] —I mean, have you been up recently

6

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

Bushnell:
I haven’t been up recently. I’ve been up, oh maybe ten years ago. It’s the
same pretty much except, of course, there’s more, there are more buildings, and there’s
more to see in the way of buildings at Stanford. But it was fun. It was very exciting.
I was going to tell you another interesting story. Oh this reunion, this fifty year reunion
that I’m attending right now is especially exciting because it’s also the fiftieth reunion of
one of the committees I served on which was called the Associated Students of Stanford
University. It was an official committee of the university that sponsored about ten
foreign scholars. Now this was back in the days when there weren’t that—I mean, there
were some foreign students at Stanford, mostly as graduate students and a few
undergraduates, but not a whole lot; not as many as they have now. And we didn’t have a
lot of people from foreign countries as undergrads at that time. We had some but not a
lot. At that time, we sponsored these students and the student body paid for it, I believe.
It came out of our student body funds. It was a regular official committee. And we had
about, I don’t know, something like ten Americans that were supposed to kind of orient
these foreign students, and help them adjust, and give them little fun things to do and
little excursions, and so on. We were sort of kind of taking care of them and getting to
know them. And they would also get to know us and have sort of a personal contact
among the student body. So we’re having our fifty year reunion for this committee also.
And it was a fun committee then. We did have a lot of fun together. And of all the
students, I think we have at least five or six, maybe seven of the foreign scholars that
have come for this reunion. So we have them from all over: from India, from the
Netherlands, from France, from where else? From Norway and one from China who
actually ended up living in San Jose, so he’s going to be coming tomorrow I think.
But one of the most interesting experiences on that committee—we had a lot of them, but
one of the most interesting was the time that Eleanor Roosevelt came to campus to speak.
She came to speak at Memorial Auditorium. And one of the fellows—American
members of the committee—I believe his name was Chuck Halsted. [Charles H. Halsted]
I think it was Chuck Halsted. Somehow or other he was, I think his mother had
married—no, his father had married Eleanor Roosevelt’s daughter but this was a later in
life marriage. [Note: Anna Roosevelt, 1906-1975, married Dr. James Addison Halsted,
her third husband, in 1952.] And so he knew her; and he invited her to come and be the
guest of the Stanford Foreign Scholar Committee. I think it was called Foreign Scholar
Commission, official name. [Foreign Scholarship Commission] And so the fun thing was
we were going to have Eleanor Roosevelt for dinner. And that was very exciting. Well
being -- what were we, 19 or something, 20 -- and not being very experienced in such
things, we only thought through where are we going to hold this? Well we were going to
hold it at one of, the Chairman’s home in Atherton. Her parents were on a trip or
something, so we would have the house. And when we got to the house – Oh, I know
how it is—Eleanor Roosevelt rode over to the house in her limousine. And I remember
that limousine leaving Memorial Auditorium. I was, for some reason I was standing in
front of the Memorial Auditorium, she got into the limousine and it was a very old
fashioned car, you know, with kind of a rounded back. And I saw her sitting there
silhouetted. This was later in the evening. She was silhouetted from behind and she had
a driver who was driving her over. And she just looked very elegant but kind of, it was a

7

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

lonely kind of thing. It was sort of a poignant moment to see her do that, to get into the
car and leave.
But somehow or other, I got over to this house along with the other members of the
committee, and suddenly we realized we didn’t have any food prepared. And Eleanor
Roosevelt was there for dinner. Well Eleanor Roosevelt obviously is a very adaptable
woman who is used to very many different circumstances. So Mardy—Mardy [Margery]
Keyes, her name is Mardy Keyes Morel-Seytoux now. She married a Frenchman who
was associated with the committee, but he wasn’t one of our scholars, I don’t believe.
She said “Well, my mother has a freezer. So let’s get something out of the freezer.” So
we went in the freezer and we found tuna fish and noodle casserole frozen solid. And she
said “Well, we’ll just heat this up.” Well I don’t know. Somebody—all—none of us had
any cooking experience. We couldn’t get the thing to defrost. So we took an ice pick
and we were hacking at this tuna fish casserole, and hacking and hacking. It was frozen
absolutely solid, and there were no microwaves in those days, of course. And we didn’t
know how to cook. And finally we got enough chipped off to heat up in a pan. We added
a little water and we got a little pile of this, and we got enough to put on a plate, and we
got enough to serve Mrs. Roosevelt. So Mrs. Roosevelt was served and nobody else was
served; and she sat there very elegantly as if nothing was wrong, as if this is what she did
every day. And she sat there with her plate of half frozen, probably, ice picked, tuna fish
and noodle casserole. And I don’t even remember whether the rest of it ever got
defrosted. I actually have a picture of us at that moment; none of us is eating, of course.
And but I assume Eleanor Roosevelt had something to eat, that little bit we gave her. But
that was a very memorable moment, too. Nevertheless, I have learned to always prepare
when I’m having a guest for dinner from that.
But another notable person on the campus at that time was Alexander Kerensky who was
President of Russia in 1917 for several months. [Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky, 18811970, Prime Minister of the Russian Provisional Government, 1917] It was all during
this tumultuous time in Russia. And he came to Stanford, to study, I believe, at the
Hoover Institution. There were a lot of Russian documents there. And he was seen on
campus. And I remember he came to my dorm, one of the Row houses I was living in at
the time, and sat across from me. I don’t remember what was spoken. He seemed like a
very nice, mild-mannered gentleman. I don’t remember much about it, but I do
remember he was Alexander Kerensky. But we had a lot of exciting, many exciting
visitors on campus. It was lots of fun.
Reinhardt:
Bushnell:

Good.
I can go on about all sorts of other memories if you want.

Reinhardt: You know, whatever you’d like to do. I don’t—it doesn’t have to have a
particular structure but just, I think, some other activities that you participated in, and
maybe some of your impressions of the student body, what it was like a little bit, and
weave that in however you’d like.

8

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

Bushnell: Okay, well I’ll just maybe, give you some vignettes from out of my stock of
memories. Of course, I think every Stanford student remembers the fragrance of
eucalyptus, especially after it rains. That’s one of my strong memories. I remember Dr.
Wallace Sterling’s rich, deep, measured voice. [STERLING, J. E. WALLACE, President
of the University. B.A., Toronto, 1927; M.A., Alberta, 1930; Ph.D., Stanford, 1938;
LL.D., Pomona, 1949, Occidental, 1949, San Francisco, 1950, Toronto, 1950. At
Stanford, 1932-37, and since 1949.] He had such a wonderful voice. You just can’t
forget something like that.
Life in the dorm was very interesting. Life is very different in those days from today,
with women’s dorms and men’s dorms; we didn’t have, you know, men and women
living in the same dorm as they do today. And it was quite an elegant life. We had
hashers but the hashers actually served us. They brought food to the table, you know,
they brought plated food to the table just as you would have in a restaurant. And I looked
back at some of my photos from that time and I noticed some of the more occasions we
had lace table cloths. So it was all very elegant and quite a nice, proper sort of life in a
way.
We didn’t have cell phones, of course. We did have telephones though. Of course, we
had telephones. We weren’t that long ago. If a guest wanted to get, to reach one of us,
they would call and there was, in the main dorms, there was a switchboard. In the
smaller dorms, somebody just picked up the phone and called your name, you know:
“This is for you, so and so.” But in the big dorms, there was a switchboard, and the call
would come through, and then every room had a buzzer. And there was this little buzzer
on the wall. And it was like a little button you push, and for the women, I don’t know
about the men, but for the women, everybody had a little needle attached to the plate of
the buzzer with tape. And then you would -- the little needle had a thread in it, the thread
was attached to a piece of tape, which hung, so the needle hung from this little plate.
And then the needle—you’d always put the needle on top of the little button before you
went out, because if anybody wanted you, the buzzer’s vibration would make the needle
drop. So you knew someone wanted you while you were out. So, um, that was always
fun because then you would—if you were there, you could buzz back. You’d buzz back
and say, “Yeah, I’m here.” Then you’d go down the hall to talk on the phone. And it
was a house phone type of thing. But then if you wanted to call out, then you had ‘all
out’ phones, you know, regular pay phones too. But the buzzer noise, I’ll never forget
that. It was sort of a rasping, rude sound but very welcome to most of the women,
especially when it was a nice gentleman on the other end. And I felt that, in those days,
women were treated with, very much treated with respect, and it was a very chivalrous
sort of relationship. They would generally—the fellows that the women liked anyway
always opened the doors for them. You know, they opened the car door for them, come
around to the other side and open the car door. And I thought that was nice. And I still
think it’s nice. My husband still does it. Of course, he comes from the same generation.
My son doesn’t do it, I don’t think.
I’d like to talk a little bit about the other women of Stanford. There were—Stanford
seemed to employ some very nice women as house mothers in the dorms. [Note: a

9

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

housemother’s title was Director of the dormitory.] I remember a Mrs. Trainor, in—T-RA-I-N-O-R, I believe—Margaret Trainor, I think that was her name. [Miss Margaret M.
Trainor, Director of Florence Moore by 1957] She was a house mother at Roble Hall,
and she lived there. And she was very nice, always remembered your name. And even
on the Row, when I lived on the Row, in one of the Row houses, we had a house mother.
These were people; women in their probably fifties, sixties, maybe. They seemed very
old to me at the time but now not so old; but very nice, motherly types of women. There
was a woman who lived at the Women’s Clubhouse. I think her name was Miss Kibby or
something like that. [Dorothy Tibby, Women’s Clubhouse hostess.] I guess she -- I
assume her job was to kind of keep tabs on what was happening at the Women’s
Clubhouse.
There was a nice -- another woman I remember named Barbara Cochran who worked at
the Stanford Placement Service. And she was very helpful getting summer jobs and parttime jobs. And very friendly and always remembered your name and always—you felt
she was really looking out for the kind of job you were looking for. There was another
woman who worked at the Hoover Tower. I don’t remember her name; she had very thick
glasses, but I know she was one of the people meeting us as we came down after the
earthquake. We came down—the elevator came down and opened at the bottom of the
Hoover Tower. But she always seemed to be around the Hoover Tower. The gym, the
women’s gym had some very nice, dedicated women. They used to hand out gym clothes
but they were so nice. I felt that everybody was very nice here. It was sort of—there was
always this feeling this was the Stanford family. I hope that’s still the way it is today.
You always felt that the people that worked here were here to support you and help you.
They’d go out of your way to be helpful and kind to you. As a matter of fact, there was a
tradition in those days—maybe there still is—if you walked down Palm Drive, if you
would start walking down Palm Drive, there was the tradition that someone would always
stop to pick you up and take you the rest of the way downtown or coming back, opposite.
And so we, I did that a number of times; met some nice people that way. But it was, you
know, you didn’t feel that you were endangering yourself or anything, getting into their
car. Everybody seemed very friendly and nice.
Reinhardt: Circling back around to the house mothers. I wonder how you perceived
their role. What did you think their job was to do?
Bushnell:
I just thought they were there just to—I don’t know, I just—because they
seemed like nice people. I didn’t feel they were watching over me, or I don’t remember
ever being disciplined by one, or having them ever tell me I should do something
different. I just think they were there to—I suppose if I had needed to talk with someone,
maybe they would have been open. They seemed like the kind of people that would have
been. They just were just nice people, just …
Reinhardt:

Did you have hours that you had to be back by or…

Bushnell:
Yes we did. I don’t remember the hours except that I know that we had to
get special permission to stay out later than a certain time, which I don’t remember.

Certainly midnight was too late, I think. Actually we had ‘overnights’ at Stanford, where
usually a fraternity would have an overnight to some place. I think I went to one down at
Monterey, and they would rent motel rooms. And it was all proper as far as I know. I
mean, I’m sure maybe not all of them were proper. The ones I went on were proper.
And then they’d have a party and a dance and a dinner. And, for some reason, it was
very exciting to stay overnight. And then the next night or the next day, you came back
to campus. But that was, you know, that was the big event, a big outing I guess for
Stanford students. It just shows how I guess we were rather protected, but we had a good
time and we didn’t, I didn’t feel, you know, that I was constrained in any way. One thing
I want to mention is that at the time we went to Stanford, there were a lot of people still
around who had been here, you know, in early part of the 1900’s. And even the physical
plant, the chairs were those—first of all, a lot of the wainscoting, the original redwood
wainscoting that was in the original classrooms was still there. It hadn’t been all polished
up. It was just the way it was.
Reinhardt:

It was redwood, huh?

Bushnell:
It was, yeah, I’m pretty sure it was redwood. You know, the redwood,
it’s still there but I think they’ve polished it and made it look, brought out the beauty of
the wood now. But we had the original chairs—I’m sure they were the original old desks
from maybe 1900 or 1890. And in History Corner, there was a cement floor. The floor
was cement, and the sound of those chairs scraping on the cement is a sound that I can
still hear today. It’s never to be forgotten. They’re sort of the Windsor type of chair. I
don’t know if Windsor is the right name but it’s that type. Some of those classrooms,
you know, were in tiers—T-I-E-R-S. Engineering Corner, I believe History Corner, had
the tiers of chairs. You could move them around, and now I think they have these plush,
theatre-type seating in all those places. The chairs are all plush and fixed. They’re not
the way we had them.
Undergraduate life was very, very—lots of fun. Oh, one thing I should mention is that
when I was a freshman in our triplet, you know, the three of us together, one of my
roommates went to some kind of a bazaar or something and came back with baby
chickens. So we raised baby chickens in her room until they got too big. And when they
-- the cleaning lady never said anything; she just cleaned up the chicken, chicken doings.
But I eventually was able to find a home for the chickens. So they went to a good home.
But I don’t know what would have happened to them otherwise. But it was funny: when
my roommate would go to class, the chickens would jump all over the room, of course,
and take over the room.
I’m sure other people have spoken of the ‘pinning’ tradition at Stanford where you
have—when someone gets pinned from, I think, from a fraternity. I was never pinned but
my roommate was. And it’s really a beautiful tradition where the fraternity would come
below the window—the fraternity members would come and they would sing below the
window or outside the window, I guess, if it was not on the upper floor. And they would
sing to the person who was pinned. And it was really quite elegant and it was a very nice
tradition. Very kind of genteel, I thought. We also wore Lanz dresses if you—I don’t

11

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

know if you know what a Lanz dress is. Well, that was very popular, and almost all of us
had at least one Lanz dress. And the Lanz dress, of course, was like—from Lanz of
Austria which is the Austrian, kind of a dirndl type, and crinoline petticoats had just sort
of—I think they had been very popular when we were in high school, and they were still
pretty popular when we were freshman and even maybe sophomores; so most of us had
Lanz dresses. And another thing that I remember is the fire drills in the middle of the
night. I wonder if they still have them. I was readingThe Quad and I’m beginning to
wonder. I thought the firemen came from somewhere else. Maybe they were students.
They were all very handsome, I know that. But all the women would come out in their
curlers and bathrobes and certainly not wanting to be seen by anyone. But maybe these
were the student firemen. I understand we had students…
Reinhardt:

We had a student fire?

Bushnell:
We had a student fire department, and it was only run by students. I
looked in The Quad. That’s what it said. [Note: the Quad says there was a “skeleton
staff of full-time employees,” and fourteen part-time students who lived in the Firehouse.]
Reinhardt:

Oh my goodness.

Bushnell:
They attended to any fires on campus. I’m amazed that they were given
that responsibility but evidently they were. But the firemen that appeared for the fire
drills looked more professional somehow than students. They they didn’t look familiar to
me. They were just good looking guys. And then—oh, another thing that’s interesting is
that in those days, we didn’t ride so many bicycles. Some of us rode bicycles but it was
not the way it is today. It seems as if we walked most places or we drove, but we didn’t
ride bicycles all that much. At lunchtime, people walking back from the Quad to have
lunch at their dorms, there was just an army, just a mass of students walking up by the
Old Union, by the Bookstore. And then you’d get to this place where the Post Office
was. At that time, we had the Post Office, which was on a little island. You got to this
point where the Row would go straight ahead, and then if you turned right, you would go
to Roble [Hall] and Lagunita [Court]. And this little island—and it was the original
Stanford Post Office built back when the university began, and everybody had to stop at
the Post Office, of course, and get their mail and then proceed on. But it was all, we were
all walking. And bicycles, I think, have really taken over this campus from what I see.
You have to really watch where you’re going.
Reinhardt:

Yes.

Bushnell:
Florence Moore [Hall] was built while I was an undergraduate. And it
was lived in before I graduated. I sort of regret in some sense that I didn’t live there
because it was a very, you know, a brand new dorm and quite nice. I remember there
was, Florence Moore actually was alive. And I think she came, you know, Mrs. Moore
came on campus and to see her namesake dorm. I remember in the process of building it,
one of the fraternities, probably the most mischievous fraternity let’s say, apparently
helped themselves to some of the construction machinery at night, one night, somehow

12

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

turned it on and roared around on it. At least that was what I heard. I’m don’t know for
sure if that’s true.
Reinhardt:

You weren’t there.

Bushnell:
I wasn’t there to see it but I heard a lot about it. Also I lived at—when
I was a graduate student, I lived at another house on Alvarado Row and I believe it was
the house that the original—what was it—Registrar of Stanford—I think his name was
Clark. [CLARK, GEORGE ARCHIBALD, Academic Secretary. B.L., Minnesota, 1891,
A.M., 1911. At Stanford, 1891-1918. Clark lived at 14 Alvarado Row. The first Stanford
Registrar was Orrin Leslie Elliott.] Well, his daughter still lived in the house but she was
quite an elderly lady by that time. And she took in boarders. And I lived in that house on
Alvarado. I think the Law School stands there where this part of Alvarado Row used to
be.
And I remember at football games, yes, football games, we’d all have feathers in our hair
because we were the Indians then, of course. And all the girls wore red skirts and white
blouses. That was just something you had to do. And often they would wear white shoes
too, although I don’t think I had white shoes. I know I had a red skirt and white blouse
and the feather. And another memory from sc—those days is going to L’Omelette
Restaurant.. It’s not there anymore. I think there’s a Walgreen’s [drug store] there now.
And there was a fireplace in the round there, and everybody went there. It was just the
Stanford hangout. We’d go and sit around the fire and chat. It was fun.
Reinhardt:
Bushnell:

Let’s see.
Anything else you’d like to know about Stanford?

Reinhardt: Oh, well, maybe some thoughts about how things have changed and what
you think about that.
Bushnell:
How things have changed. Well, many more buildings of course. I think
the changes at Stanford reflect the changes in society as a whole. This was a time, this
was before Vietnam. It was a time of—and we were coming out of the Forties. It was in
between, and we were kind of a quiet generation. So we pretty much, we didn’t mind
obeying people. It was all right to obey people and do what we were told. I mean, not all
of us but I think, in general, we were content to do what we were supposed to do and not
make many waves. It was maybe a more conformist time in some ways, although I think
you can conform in the other direction too. And the campus: I think that the changes,
you know, the way people treat each other, the relationships of men and women and so
on, I think this just reflects what’s going on in society as a whole. I think students are
very lucky. They certainly have, you know, a beautiful university. I don’t think it’s—in
some sense, I think we had something very special. We were a smaller group of students
in those days, and the graduates, I believe, there were fewer graduate students in those
days. I’m not sure but I know that the numbers are in our little class book; it gives the
numbers. And there were far more—I think there were twice as many men as women in

13

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

those days. And I think that all makes a little bit of a different atmosphere. But it was a
great time. It was a great time to go to school. I’m glad I went there then. I think I’m
glad I went there then, and if I had to choose I’d rather be a student back then. It was just
nice. It was a little smaller.
Reinhardt: What made you decide to come to Stanford or did you, that was just where
you were going to go?
Bushnell:
Well I just heard about Stanford my whole life. And I’d always wanted to
come here. And I was very, you know, I only heard good things about Stanford and was
always very impressed, and knew some Stanford graduates, adults who were Stanford
graduates who always said good things. I never heard anything bad about Stanford. So
and it was just, you know, sort of something I was always striving to do, and I was very
pleased and very fortunate that I could do that. I was a very lucky person. I feel I’ve
been very lucky. My whole life, I’ve just been lucky.
Reinhardt: So what about graduation? Did you do anything special or different, or
what was it like? No wacky walk or…
Bushnell:
No, we didn’t have wacky walk—I mean, I was not aware of any wacky
walk. It was very serious. You know, that was when our band was a traditional band.
You know, no Stanford; typical contemporary Stanford band. It was a regular marching
band. And graduation was serious. I don’t remember who the—the speaker was. I could
look that up. I think I still have my graduation pamphlet around somewhere. But it
was—I don’t remember—I remember that it was, you know, we took pictures.
Reinhardt:

Where was it held?

Bushnell:
It was held in Frost Amphitheatre before Frost Amphitheatre was fenced
off. Now it’s fenced off, you know, you can’t just wander in. But in those days,
everything was open. In fact, you could go there for a picnic if you wanted to. And I did,
sometimes. You know, if you wanted to get away from it all and just go and have a nice
picnic in a beautiful surrounding, you could just, you know, stroll over to Frost. It was
held in Frost. And so --and then I think it’s always been held there, has it not? Or do
they hold it somewhere else now?
Reinhardt:
Bushnell:
Reinhardt:

Now it’s in the stadium, the football stadium.
Oh, the football stadium. Oh okay. Yeah.
So any, like a favorite place on campus that you used to like to go to?

Bushnell:
Ummm, favorite place on campus. I just liked it all over. I liked it
everywhere on campus. No, I can’t think of any places, except when I lived at Mrs.
Clark’s, or Miss Clark’s, I guess it is, on Alvarado Row, she had a. it was a regular home
where she had apparently grown up. And they had a big, old fashioned swing and I used

14

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

to like to sit out there in the swing. It was a nice, relaxing time. But I can’t remember
any other particular place. I used to spend a lot of time in the library and the stacks
studying.
Reinhardt:

Was the library open long hours?

Bushnell:
I don’t think it was open as long as it is now; probably not. I remember
coming back maybe 9:00 or —I’m just guessing. I just don’t remember for sure. Yeah.
Reinhardt:

No ‘all nighters’ in the library?

Bushnell:
I don’t remember -- no, I don’t think it was open all night -- I doubt it very
much. But maybe, you know, maybe it was.
Reinhardt:

Yeah. Is there a favorite memory that you have of all of your time?

Bushnell:
Oh, I just have so many good memories, all of these memories that I’ve
been talking about. I think my first year as a graduate student was probably my favorite,
just because I think I was a little bit older and not so much in awe of everything. So I
was really able to enjoy everything without being sort of overly overwhelmed by the
great teaching, the great people, the great place. It was just, I think it was because I was a
little bit older then.
Reinhardt:
Bushnell:
Reinhardt:

Yeah.
But it was, the whole thing was just a great experience.
Wonderful.

Bushnell:
And I wouldn’t mind doing it again but I think I would find it, in some
ways, easier, in some ways, more difficult. Yeah, I’m sort of glad that I, you know, I
don’t have to go back and do it again.
Reinhardt:
notes?

Anything that I haven’t thought of to ask about that you have in your

Bushnell:
Let me see if there’s anything here, just ... Oh just another memory. I
don’t know if that…
Reinhardt:

Sure.

Bushnell:
When I lived at Roble, I took—I think this was when I was a freshman,
yes—I used to want to practice my speeches, but you can’t do that when you have a
whole lot of, you know, roommates and you don’t want to wake them up. So I used to
get up really early and go out behind Roble, and Roble’s right next to Lake Lagunita. So
I used to just sit on the edge of Lake Lagunita and say my speeches. And you could see

15

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/KAY FELDSMITH BUSHNELL

the sun come up. It was very pretty. It was kind of misty. It must have been fall quarter,
maybe winter quarter. So it was kind of cold, and I remember doing that, and some of
the hashers would be going to work and coming around the path, you know, the path that
goes around the rim of the lake. That’s a special memory. I have a lot of special
memories, and probably a lot of buried memories that I can’t remember. But I might
remember sometime, you know, if I hear somebody else talk about them. I think our
student body—I’ve heard people say that our student body is much more diverse today,
and in some sense it is more diverse, because you have a lot—I think socio-economically,
it’s perhaps more diverse. and ethnically perhaps more diverse. But I felt there was a
tremendous amount of diversity just among the people who were there. I mean, I met
people whom I never would have met otherwise or never would have talked to from all
these different backgrounds, simply because they came from all over the place, from
different family situations; many of them had lived abroad even though they were not
necessarily foreign students, official foreign students. But I thought there was plenty of
diversity. It certainly wasn’t a homogeneous group as far as differences among people.
So I thought—it was a great experience, and this reunion’s a great experience also.
Reinhardt:
Bushnell:
Reinhardt:
Bushnell:

You’re just starting that.
Yeah, I’m just starting it, and it’s going to be more and more fun I’m sure.
Oh yeah. So is there anything else you’d like to add?
Hmmm. I think that’s all for now.

Reinhardt: Okay, we’ll wrap up and I’m supposed to say again this is—I’m Trudy
Reinhardt and I’m interviewing Kay Bushnell and it’s Thursday, October 9th, 2008.
Thank you very much.
Bushnell:

You’re welcome. Thank you.
