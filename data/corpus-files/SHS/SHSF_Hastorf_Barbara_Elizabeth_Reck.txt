SOHP Interview: Barbara Hastorf with Mimi Webb and Joanne O'Donohue Interview 1: April 9, 1986

Donohue: Barbara, what was it like when you came to Stanford?

Hastorf: Actually, we came in 1954 for a year's visit and then again in 1958 before we moved here in 1969, so I had a chance to see Stanford before it became our residence. It seemed to me, coming from an Eastern College, that it was quite a sleepy community with students lying in the sun with shorts on, rather than bustling to and from classes to the library with books under their arms. But on the other hand, it turned out that the students really were very conscientious and really dedicated to being good students. When we moved here I finally found out they were quite active, especially when A1 got into the Psychology Department and was a regular member of the faculty. It opened all sorts of doors into administration, into the Psychology Department and certainly into the student body.

O'Donohue: What did it look like? Did the appearance of the University change a lot?

Hastorf: Yes, oh my goodness. I guess you can see by old maps and talking to other people you will find out that the post office was a quaint little building and there were many

fraternity houses around it, which have long since either been demolished or moved elsewhere on the campus. You could drive into the middle of the campus, which is something you can't get close to today. Some of the new dorms were opened--post-war dormitories, which now are really quite old dorms on the campus.

'Donohue: Did you live on campus from the beginning?

Hastorf: We rented a house on the campus, yes, one of the original old houses that was built by Mrs. Stanford for one of the faculty coming from the University of Indiana. The Drells [Professor Sidney Drell] live in that house new. It's one of the only ones on that block that hasn't been torn down. But that was quite a walk to the heart of campus, through residential areas when we first came. Now it's right next door to the parking lot of a University building.

Webb:

Can you tell us anything specific about the house?

Hastorf: Yes. The house--I can't tell you who it was built for--but I can tell you that Mrs. Stanford inquired of this faculty member the size of his family and the number of servants that he had so that she could build the house accordingly. It was a very tall, three-story house, finished on all three floors. It did have a basement heater and the heater heated the entrance hall and that was it.

The way heat rises, it went up to the second floor and the third floor, so I found it a bit chilly living there in the winter. But it was--still is--an interesting house. The Drells, who are in it just love it. They think it's one of the greatest residences on the Stanford campus.
O'Donohue How did your family adapt? Did you have children when you came?
Hastorf: Yes, we had two girls; one of them was in Stanford Elementary and the other was in Terman Junior High School. They were lonely, needless to say, for their pals back in New England and we found that--I found that going to the Stanford school was probably not the best idea but there was not much choice unless one went into private education.
It was a hyper school with very bright kids; each one of them thought he was the brightest. For someone coming from a more diverse school system, it was really quite a shock. The competition was extremely keen.
O'Donohue: How did you help them through this?
Hastorf: Many visits to the teacher and keeping a watch eye on the teacher and the school through the PTA. One of the curious things that did happen in that class, it was the sixth grade: one of the students was Laurie Hofstadter and her

older brother, who was about three years older, the teacher was not giving them any mathematics, arithmetic or anything else. So Doug Hofstadter volunteered and came in a couple times a week and taught the kids new math and they loved him and they loved new math. That was the highlight of their week.
O'Donohue: Were these schools right on campus?
Hastorf: Stanford Elementary was right where Pearce Mitchell [housing] is located today. It had that whole block. It was a little, round school with two wings going off to either side. One class for each grade, so it was very quaint and very neighborly. Everyone who went there could walk to school. They could take their lunch. It did have a lot of community spirit at the time because everybody who went there lived within a half mile of the school. There were marvelous field days where the children had races. The girls were always better than the boys athletically--they could go faster, had longer legs, so they could jump the hurdles better. It was a fund-raiser, but mostly it was just for fun.
O'Donohue: Were you involved at all in the school system and in the community?
Hastorf: Well, yes, in the school in that particular year, but

5

then the other daughter was in Terman and I was in the PTA over there and continued right on through until they all graduated the Palo Alto Schools.

Webb:

Barbara, are you talking about the year 1961 when you came here permamently?

Hastorf: Yes.

O'Donohue: When you had visited earlier, what years were those and hew long did you stay?

Hastorf: We stayed almost a year each time--a full academic year. In 1954 and we came because my husband was in the beginning group at the Behavioral Science Center. We lived just off Stanford Avenue on Amherst Street in College Terrace. Then we came back again three years later. We also lived on Amherst Street, but on the ritzy side, which backed up to open fields. All the way back as far as you could see, there were no buildings. We had lots of cattle back there. The back of the house was the living room. We had a picture [window]. The whole back of the house was glass. One morning I got up early and looking in the glass window were two enormous ccws who had plowed through the garden right up to the window. So I had to discretely get them back through the narrow little opening that they had found, back in the field again.

But it was marvelous, having all that open space and green space behind us.

Webb:

How did that rural type of setting compare to what you had at Dartmouth?

Hastorf: It compared equally, because we lived at the end of a road in Dartmouth. If we walked, we could walk forever and never run into anybody, just walk through woods and up and down hills. So that although this was open fields, it was unpopulated, which was very similar to where we had come from.

O'Donohue: Was it a big decision to come to Stanford?

Hastorf: Enormous. Enormous. I think, when I think back, it was a one-to-three decision. The three women in the family were against it (laughs). But we came, and within a year we were really happy we did. We went back the next summer to visit all our old friends and after a couple of weeks both girls came up and said, "Mom, when are we going home?" By then I knew we bridged the gap and that they were Californians, which they have been to this day.

O'Donohue So it has been home ever since.

Hastorf: Yes.

7

Webb:

What kind of welcome did you receive when you came in 1961, welcome from faculty, department, administration?

Hastorf: A1 came in the Psychology Department and I would say we had a very warm welcome. It was a smaller department than it is now, to some extent. Everybody was a free spirit but they all seemed to care about other people in the department, so that we were wined and dined and met almost everybody immediately.

0'Donahue: What was expected of you?

Hastorf: Well, at that point, nothing was expected of me. Let me also say that when we came, we didn't come just to the Psychology Department, but A1 was half-time in the Business School, although he's a psychologist by preference and by training. So we had double welcome as far as being welcomed was concerned. I remember, certainly almost immediately going to a marvelous get-together party at the Arbuckle's. I think if anybody was responsible for our coming it was Ernie Arbuckle. There we met, in particular, the Ponds, Pete sat next to me at dinner. From then on we've been probably the closest of friends. It was a year with many new appointments in the Business School. There must have been 20 it seems. It was a huge party. Right now I can't remember everybody who was there. It was very large for an

8
incoming group.
I think Stanford was really at that point on the make. They had turned over a leaf. They said, "We really want to be a more important university." All the schools were growing. The student body was increasing. It was very lively intellectually.
O'Donohue: When you say that Ernie Arbuckle was responsible for A1 coming, what do you mean?
Hastorf: Ernie decided he wanted social psychology in the Business School, so he had the year before hired Alex Bavelas and he set up with Alex in command, a research lab on the campus. A1 came to join, so the two of them ran many graduate students in their research.
O'Donohue: Did you get involved with students?
Hastorf: After that I most certainly did, in many ways. Let's see, hew did we get started on that? A1 at Christmas time of the first year became Chairman of the Psychology Department, so that opened up--it cut off a little of the Business School connection because he devoted full time to Psychology, but I think he had a few Business School graduates at the time. So as far as students go, I did not have close contacts with Business School students. But I

9
did with Psychology students, because he had graduate students in Psychology and also undergraduates. Most of them came to our house at some time or another. Every year he has had courses with students we have had them [come over].
When he became Chairman of Psychology, that did open up both the faculty and the students, as far as I was concerned. I took part much more in activities of the Department. Whenever they were hiring somebody, we always had some there at our home and annual get-togethers. It was a friendly Department, as I look back. I was supportive of the Stanford Faculty Women's Club, which at that time was really quite an important organization on the campus.
At that time the elderly women were complaining that they no longer had a clubhouse. However, it had a large membership and every fall I had all of the people from the department over for lunch or for something so that we could all go off en masse to the opening meeting of the Stanford Faculty Women's Club where they could learn what groups they could join and meet people. But that has dwindled, that interest, I have discovered.
0'Donohue: When you say Faculty Women's Club, were these wives of faculty or other women who were...?

10

Hastorf: The ones I was concerned with were mainly wives of the faculty in the Psychology Department, and also Psychologists who were at the Behavioral Science Center, those wives, because mostly men went to the Behavioral Science Center at that time. They had a few women each year, but mostly men.

Webb:

Barbara, you mentioned your involvement when A1 became chairman of the Department and you said you had things at your house--I think you were referring to recruting dinners....

Hastorf: Yes. In the meantime, we lived in the Drell's house for one year and that was the year of adjustment --Business School and Psychology and then we moved here the next spring. So this is where I did most of the entertaining. In the fall we had the whole Department, husbands, wives and graduate students and their spouses, to meet each other here.

O'Donohue: Were those kinds of things that were expected of you anything like at Dartmouth?

Hastorf: On a bigger scale. I had no formula that I had to follow; it was done because we both felt it was important and we wanted to do it.

O'Donohue: Was there a pattern of that sort of thing that you observed here?

Webb:

Other departments doing that sort of thing?

Hastorf: Well, I didn't have enough contact with other departments, so I didn't learn from other people's experiences.

O'Donohue: Have you found that your role has changed according to the kinds of jobs your husband had? Were you always...

Hastorf: I think the role changes, but I also think the "cast of characters" changes and that the roles go with the people you are dealing with. Now, way back when we first came, it was certainly the Psychology Department and then we went three different times to overseas campuses which enlarged cur horizons as far as student connections are concerned. That's a whole chapter in and of itself.

O'Donohue: It would be nice to hear some of your recollections of those overseas experiences.

Hastorf: I think they were just marvelous. I guess right now when I look back at any students that we meet now who had been students back in the 60s and early 70s--those were our overseas experience times--relate that the overseas

experiences to them were the most outstanding part of their education at Stanford.

We went for two quarters to

outside of

Vienna. That was one that first opened. We were with

Austria One, the first in Austria, too. Then a few years

later we went back to Austria when it was in downtown

Vienna. We also went for a quarter to open up Clivedon in

England.

O'Donohue: Did your daughters accompany you?

Hastorf: Not with us. The first time we went, Christy, the

younger one, was a sophomore in high school, so she went

early in September to an American school in Vienna. Betsy

had just graduated from Paly High, went to a French Friend's

School in

area of France for the year Then the

second time we went, Betsy was a student at Stanford at the

Florence campus and Christy was back here as a Freshman. So

they were not in residence with us.

O'Donohue: You mentioned earlier the cast of characters changes and we've wondered about the political climate at Stanford and something about the administrations that would effect the cast of characters, the styles of different administrations.

Hastorf: We came, of course, under Wallace Sterling's era. I thought they were both very strong leaders and I'm really

13
very devoted fans of both Mrs. Sterling and Wallace Sterling. I know, I can say for Anne, she is really a bumptious woman who really cared a great deal about people and the cxammunity. Oftentimes before a Stanford Faculty Women's meeting she would have a luncheon for about six people and many times I was included. I enjoyed it? it gave me a little more interest in the Stanford Faculty Women's Club by that introduction. Also, she every year would have the heads of the departments over to her house for a bag lunch before school opened, just to launch the SFWC. We'd have a real pep talk and we'd take our bag lunch and we got to meet the other faculty chairman's wives, whose husbands were chairman. That was helpful and broadened our horizons.
That built a community that I thought was very important, so you really knew who was here and not just a name in a catalog.
O'Donohue: Did that continue, that sense of community?
Hastorf: Well, it did through the Sterling era. Then the Pitzer era, I was really kind of out of touch. I think we were in Europe at that time and although I did meet them, certainly one could not say that they carried any great feeling of buoyancy, because they were so new and we were leading them, not them leading....

14
Then of course with Dick Lyman and Jing--we were neighbors of theirs right from the very start and our children grew up together, so they were old friends. They too were a couple that I think exuded a lot of enthusiasm and concern, for the students in particular, and women, as history has already pointed out.
O'Donohue: We began our conversation talking about your observation of students and you've lived here through some rather exhuberant...
Hastorf: And wild...
O'Donohue: ...wild times. Can you say something about students and how you might have seen them change?
Hastorf: Well, students, I thought when we first came, were not excitable and not necessarily full of brilliant new ideas. They did pretty well what they were told and they had their shenanigans in the fraternity houses. Then, of course, Berkeley got started with the so-called revolution and before we knew it, here it was at Stanford. It was a scary time. I myself wasn't involved but I certainly sat here at night and listened to the rhetoric that we could hear on the campus radio. Many nights A1 was out on the campus controlling it, and at meetings.

15

O'Donohue: How involved was he?

Hastorf: He wasn't on the front line, let's put it that way. Part of that time we were at one of the overseas campuses so we kind of came home into the middle of it. So we weren't here when they rocked cars and turned it over, but we were here for the second phase of it.

Webb:

What was Al's role at that time?

Hastorf: That's just about when he came back as Dean of H&S, Humanities and Sciences.

Webb:

Were your girls on campus at that time?

Hastorf: Yes.

Webb:

Did they have any involvement in all these activities?

Hastorf: They were not on the front line, no. Betsy played it cool. She was living in Lambda Nu and she did not get involved although I think she leant an ear to what was going on; she didn't turn it off. But Christy, on the other hand, she lived right near the Library and one night she called up about 10 o'clock, "Mom, I can't see. The tear gas. I wanted to go to the library and couldn't get there." I said," Well, would you like to come home." "No,

16
I'll stay here." But they didn't get an awful lot done academically, that's for certain. I think in a way Betsy was a lot more smitten by it than Christy, Betsy being three years older. And it really took a while for her to kind of get back on an even track, although she didn't do any rock throwing or get into any large gangs. She listened and every once in a while she came home saying, "Bruce Franklin had the greatest idea!" With that her father would bounce off the ceiling and the walls. So we had to say, "Betsy, go back to the dorm and don't come back here with thoughts about that. We know."
But there were several times when really terrible things were happening on the campus and the doorbell would ring and I had a dog and the dog would just go wild. It would be these students, boys usually, with loud voices, who would say, "I've been all day trying to get past the crowd and what are we supposed to do? What's expected." I'd say, "Come in and I'll get you something to eat." They would say, "No I can't eat, I'm just too overwrought. I haven't eaten for two days." They were really disturbed boys. The girls didn't came to the house, of course. But many times at night the boys would do that, looking for Al, who wasn't here to counsel them.
O'Donohue: Did you ever feel unsafe living right here on campus?

17

Hastorf: No, I didn't feel unsafe. A1 was not really in the lineup of who they were going to attack. I do remember, though, one time, the Lymans in the fall--in rather mild weather--had a party for A1 when he became Dean of H&S. They were living on El Escarpado and the police were absolutely everywhere. We walked up through a police file up to their door and there were a bunch of students just standing there. One of them was a young man who I'd known since before he was born, from Hanover, a little fellow. I knew his parents extremely well. They were going to move to this area. There he stood. He was a real devotee of the revolutionary forces, ready to just--to all these deans and other folks who were walking up through this file of people. I looked at him and I said, "Oh Dickie." Because that's what he used to be called. I said, "What are you doing here?" With that all his big friends said, "Oh Dickie! Oh Dickie!" I didn't mean to cut him down, but it just came out so fast. He forgave me afterwards for it. He is now a promising lawyer in San Francisco, (laughs)

SIDE TWO

Webb:

Barbara, what can you tell us about the faculty at

18

Stanford--your first impressions of them when you arrived, if you could compare the faculty to the faculty at Dartmouth and compare the faculty now in the 1980s to those you first encountered when you first came to Stanford.

Hastorf

Well, once again, because Stanford was striving and had just about attained a first-rate status in the US, the faculty--certainly in the Psychology Department, of which I can speak most familiarly about--were top of the line research-wise. Two of them are still here and extremely active and productive, Bob Sears and his wife Pat, although she wasn't in the Psych. Department, she was in Education. They both were full-time teacher/researchers. Then Jack Hilgard and Josie, who are still working, both to their full extent. They are nationally known in the field of Psychology.

One of the most salient characters who turned out to be sort of a stormy petrel-- people missed him and yet had a hard time with him--was Leon Festinger, who brought a great deal of zip and life to the Psychology Department, through his creative thinking and through the connections he brought here--by brought, I mean suggested for the faculty. Quinn McNamara was on the faculty at that time and he must be about 95. He is still alive. He and his wife Olga had offices. She had an office in the Psych. Dept. too. Quinn has been President of the American Psychological

association, as I think Jack Hilgard had, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if Bob Sears hadn't been at one time too, which shows that Stanford stood well in the national picture of the field of Psychology. Alex Bavelas was here then and he was extremely colorful, a most creative researcher. He and his wife at that time, Jane, were good friends of ours and close neighbors so we saw a great deal of them and enjoyed their company.
Then of course, Dick Atkinson arrived about the same year we did. He now is the Chancellor at San Diego, UC San Diego. There were young, by young I mean fresh FhDs teaching in the Psych. Dept., and it was vigorous, I think it was a very exciting Department. It had high enrollment. The classes were filled to bulging and the department kept growing out of its space. The Hilgards, Sears and A1 and Alex Babelas all had separate buildings where they had their research activities because there wasn't enough room to house them in the Psychology Dept. building. That was vftien they were located in Cubberley Hall.
Actually, a point of interest, the house that was right next door to where the Drells live now and Alex Babelas had his research center there and that was called the Branner House--that's where President Branner lived. Regretably they tore it down, which was too bad, because it was a charming old house.

20

I'd say it was a vigorous department and still is, but many, most of the outstanding Psychologists now have retired. Of course, Eleanor Maccoby is another who joined the faculty shortly before us. She is outstanding in the field of developmental [psychology] and she worked under Bob Sears, who brought her here.

Webb:

This was mostly during the time that A1 was chairman, when you first came? What was your involvement with the department? Was it a social involvement, did you entertain...?

Hastorf: I think it was social, yes, mostly. We entertained in the evening. I felt really a close part of the department.

Webb:

What kind of support did you get for entertaining? Help from the department--did you have an entertainment budget, or any sort of household, catering help?

Hastorf: No, I never had catering.

Webb:

Did your husband help you, or just moral support?

Hastorf: I guess I'd say I did it mostly myself. I did get reimbursed by the department. No, catering was not something that the budget ever thought about or certainly I

never thought about at that time. Catering is a more recent advantage to being on the University campus. But I can tell you a few terrible experiences. At the fall parties we had 100 to 150 guests. I knew I needed a lot of beer. I knew I needed a lot of soft drinks and I knew I needed lots of popcorn and other such things. I found a liquor store that would deliver. Not many of them would. Two different years in a row this happened with two different places. I thought once was bad enough. I ordered it in the spring. I checked on them a week before the party about the order. "Yes, everything was all right." It was the end of September and they were supposed to be here at 3 o'clock and the party was to start at 4:30. Students always come on time if not a little early. They always come hungry and thirsty. It was a hot day and at 4 o'clock they didn't come and I was on the phone. "Well, we don't know where it is, but we'll try to get it to you."
I had 150 people here with not one bit of refreshment on a hot day. I was absolutely frantic. Finally two trucks came about an hour late. Some people had already left. If I hadn't planned ahead I could have said, "Oh, it's my fault. " But not so. They forgot me. They put this cold beer in the truck at 8 in the morning and by the time it got here on a 90 degree day at 5 it was--anyway, they turned out to be great parties because everybody kind of pitched in spirit-wise and we all got--I

dodged in the house most of the time looking out the window, going "I can't go out there." But everybody got chatting and joking with each other and it turned out to be a more friendly party than many others. But two in a row!
I did get help there. The office would come over and set up a table and that was about the extent of my help. I would say that back in those days people pitched in; in other words, if you had a big "do" so-and-so would bring a turkey and so-and-so would bring that. I don't notice that that happens in the recent past.
O'Donohue: Why do you think that's so?
Hastorf: I think the women--and they were mostly men students and men faculty--the women were at home or part-time workers or volunteers and they had time. The attitude of the women then changed to," Well, this is my husband's responsibility, it's not mine." I think that's eroding. I think we've passed over that period. That for a while, I thought was hard to cope with.
O'Donohue: Do you think things are more cooperative today?
Hastorf: Yes, I think so. I think people don't have the rigidness to what they look forward to as their lifestyles that they did 8-10 years ago, when we were in the much more "cutting

23

edge" period of transition. I think we're now into a transition and people are a little more relaxed about things. But a while I did not feel that they were that relaxed.

Webb:

Barbara, you said something about people pitching in and helping and also about there was no budget for catering--how have you seen that change? Do you think there is a budget for catering now for events?

Hastorf: Well, I can't speak for this period, because I haven't participated. Certainly I've come from a budget, but nobody put a lid on it, when I was up in the Hanna Honeycomb House. But since I've been back home, a year and a half now, I have cut down.

Webb:

Let's go from chairman of the department to Dean of H&S and then the Hanna Honeycomb House....

Hastorf: No, then A1 was chairman of what's called Boys Town, which is now called the Center for Youth Development and that was about three years. And then Provost.

Webb:

Let's compare the activities then. We've already discussed the department--bring us through Boy's Town.

Hastorf: Then of course the next was H&S and we left a lot of our

24
student connections because there just wasn't enough time for them, and Al spent his time with faculty. We were oriented toward the faculty of H&S and it largely came down to the chairmen of the departments, because they were the salient people he was working with. That I found extremely interesting. For me it was fun. Not that I was into psychology myself, but conversation was psychologically oriented for the most part. And we got into physics and had marvelous people from around the world in physics and chemistry and literature. It just opened out much bigger vistas of a more complete world of academia, which I thought was very exciting.
And, of course, we got into Provost, and that was a whole different era. There you got into boards of trustees and alumni, big donors.
O'Donohue: And that was life in a different place, a different house.
Hastorf: That's exactly right. The house kind of set the stage for this big life of meeting kings and queens and princesses and all those other world characters. It's exciting. It's Impersonal and you know that this is just one little check in their big life but it still has its glamour and appeal nonetheless, or at least I found it so.

25

Webb:

At each stage of Al's career it did mark a turning point for you. How would you describe Stanford's expectations of you as these turning points occured?

Hastorf: I just never felt that Stanford superimposed any expectations on me. I could start out that way.

Webb:

Did A1 have expectations for you?

Hastorf: Well, we worked it out together. I would not say that he was dictatorial about what we must do. It just sort of happened. That's about all I could say. Between the two of us, if I saw something that needed doing, we would talk about and either do it or not do it, in the way of helping a situation or having somebody over who we felt it was important to give a little extra boost or touch to. So I don't say that Stanford put anything on me, really, until I got up in the Hanna Honeycomb house, and that was different, because that was the Stanford House.

Webb:

Can you talk a little about that?

Hastorf: I don't miss it, but I did enjoy it. The only thing I miss now is that they put in a swimming pool. I didn't get that. However, because it was the Stanford house A1 said to me that the office would pay me for what I did. I said "No thank you." If I get paid then I'll have to measure up and

26

I don't want to be in that position. I'd much rather do it because I want to." So that's the way it was.

We'd get phone calls, frequently from every organization, wanting to know if they could use the house. I think one of the greatest support teams I had there, talking about support, were the docents from the Stanford Educational Services for the Committee for Arts with the Stanford Museum. They toured the house twice a month and they had a secretary and they really protected me against a lot of invaders. I could just turn them over to them and they would either incorporate them into a tour or discretely discourage them from coming to the house. They were very protective and they liked their protective role because it gave them a worthy cause as well as just being educational tour guides. They were fantastic and also I got endless support from Al's office. They were marvelous. And we're still good friends to this day.

Webb:

What kind of support?

Hastorf: Typing, printing, mailing, well mostly secretarial type help and also screening--they did a fair amount of screening of people before they got to me to ask if they could use the house.

Webb:

Can you tell me why you needed typing, secretarial

services?
Hastorf: I certainly can. A lot of it was for my volunteer work on the Stanford campus, like getting reports. All the time I was there I had been secretary of two Stanford organizations that needed minutes, so they did minutes for me because they had all the machines and the expertise for doing that. They were just great. Also for all the bills and paying people and helping to make arrangements to get the right person to do the right thing.
I also had a man--actually I had three of them--it kind of washed out because they didn't work out for me, but the last one worked for us for a long time. I met with him concerning the maintenance of the house once a week and we'd go over the list of undone things. Then we'd talk about what needed to be done and we'd look at this, that and the other thing--the paint job it needed, the water that leaked, the grass that burned, the pool that didn't run, the trees that fell down, you know, all those things we'd go over every week. Unfortunately that meant that I had to be around on hand for when the workers came to do what they had to do. So I did give an enormous amount of my own time to the house.
O'Donohue: That was a very official role. What about some of your other activities beyond the Stanford community?

28
Hastorf: Well, I tried, in the beginning, to reach out beyond the Stanford group and I was a pink lady for quite a while in the hospital. That was interesting. Then we went away and I never got into that again. Then I joined the Palo Alto Garden Club and I enjoyed that enormously because I got to meet citizens of Palo Alto, many of them I'd known through PTA boards, which I had been on all the way through. I always felt that was worthwhile, because we did good things for the community.
Since then I've really narrowed to Stanford because I felt that was my prime interest because we were so involved. I helped on the Treasure Market there by getting on the Committee for Art board, which is not just a meeting board, but is a working board. I can certainly tell you it is a working board.
O'Donohue: When you say a working board, what kind of work?
Hastorf: Well, secretary, chairing committees, running projects, planning a trip to Europe, things like that, which I did. Just working on Treasure Market itself took at least a day a week, but I'm off that now. Then I got on the board of the Music Guild, which I hadn't given as much time to. Before you go I'll plug it, but not on this--I'll do it privately.

29

Webb:

Barbara, can you tell us what the Music Guild is.

Hastorf: The Music Guild was officially formed many years ago--actually to go back, Paul Farnsworth, who was a member of the Psychology Department, was very interested in music years ago, and it was through him and his emphasis and interest and drive that the Music Department became a Music Department at Stanford, which I think is quite interesting. It just didn't come the way other departments are. They had to work hard to get a music department. About six years ago the Music Department decided they needed help from the outside, like the Committee for Art. They were really very jealous of all the workers for the Art Department.

They hired--they made the very smart move of hiring Sandy O'Brien to be a part-time office administrator and set this thing up and get it going. She did a fantastic job and it has been thriving ever since. I'd say it has been going on for six or seven years now. It's a fundraiser for the music department. Its primary fund function is raising money to give scholarships to anybody who wants to take private lessons in any instrument or voice and you can "buy" yourself a student for $300 a year. That means that if you are a law student and you want to learn how to play the trombone, you may, without paying. The Department matches the other half. But that's what it costs somebody to buy a student, which I think is fantastic. It does give strength to the music

30

department.

Also, because they moved into the new building, they needed money for new furnishings. So we have earned money for that and endowments--a great deal of money has been raised for endowments for some of the retiring faculty: Herbert Nanney? who ran the orchestra?--Harold Schmidt; the pianist, Bailer--anyway, thousands of dollars in the endowment for those people due to the Music Guild.

Webb:

What has your role been in the Music Guild?

Hastorf: I've done secretarial work--which is a dumb job--I've just helped on projects. Right now I'm helping as co-host, cx>-chairman of a housing tour to be done, which I'll tell you about, in the middle of May, which we have to publicize extensively because it's going to be a fantastic show and we haven't had many applications yet. The invitations went out about two weeks ago and we have to keep it up.

Webb:

How did you decide which activity you would pursue--how did you decide to became active in the Music Guild?

Hastorf: I just saw a blank and filled it in for the Treasure Mart and started working. Before I knew it there I was.

Webb:

Was it because of some interest or inclinations you

31
had--were you interested in art...?
Hastorf: Well, I've been a great auditor of courses up until this year. I've always audited many of the Art and History Department, Music, English--and the art department just appealed to me, so I signed up. Then the Music Guild, Sandy O'Brien asked me to be on the board and I said yes.

SOHP Interview: Barbara Hastorf with Mimi Webb and Joanne O'Donohue Interview 2: April 25, 1986

J: Barbara, we talked a lot last time about your years at Stanford. I wonder what kinds of things prepared you for this life you lead?

Hastorf:

Well, it seems that ever since the war was over and Al

went to graduate school, we were in the academic world and we

were diverted from it, so that was the base. It was very

interesting at Princeton because everybody was freshly out of

the service; families were being created and busy working.

There was a great deal of community and that's I think where I

started reaching out for new friends and found a great number

who are friends today. And we worked with the faculty

oftentimes and the graduate students organizations. Everybody

seemed so eager to get back to work, normal life, I guess you'd

say.

Then we moved to Dartmouth and that was quite a different community. It was small but very closely woven and everybody you either knew of our knew quite well; it was like a large family. So we entertained and were entertained. Al was a graduate student at Penn State and then moved to Dartmouth as his first job. While we were there--it didn't take very long-- he had an offer from Stanford's Behavioral Science Lab and that was our introduction to the West, western living and Stanford.

O'Donohue: So you knew when you were married that you were headed for an academic life.

Hastorf:

I would say it looked that way. A1 was in the service

then so there really was no sure future.

O'Donohue: When did you meet? Can you tell us a bit about it?

Hastorf:

Yes, I ran into him when I was a freshman in college at

Holyoke. He'd come and visit his sister. She was off on the

weekend and hadn't returned home yet. My roomate had a date

with his friend and I was the substitute, and we've been

together ever since.

Webb:

So your first date with A1 was playing bridge at a home.

Hastorf:

Exactly. And we drank coca cola and listened to the juke

box.

O'Donohue: Can we go back a little bit to your own education and your own family life. What was that like? What was your family like when you were growing up?

Hastorf:

I grew up in Syracuse, New York--my mother's home town

where her relatives had been for many years. So there were lots

of her family. My father was from New York City, Brooklyn, to

3

be exact, and he worked as a traveling engineer selling steel . north of Syracuse, around upstate New York. So we didn't have too much of his family.

I had what I thought was a good, sound, happy family life. One sister. We are friends and we continue to correspond.

0'Donohue: Did you stay in the same neighborhood?

Hastorf:

We stayed there until I was in high school and then we

moved to Montclair and I went to Montclair high school.

01 Donohue:

What kinds of things did you like to do when you were a

little girl? Did you have special heroes and heroines when you

were growing up?

Hastorf:

Oh, just like every other child. Nelson Eddy. I thought

about Nelson Eddy all day long and dreamed about him at night.

I had his picture--at any rate, that was in junior high and we

all worshipped him. We had a kind of interesting group. While

other kids were doing other things that I don't know about, we

had a gang and spent a lot of time riding bicycles and spent a

lot of time in one of the person's attic dancing to waltz

music. We thought we were avant garde and really perfected the

waltz.

4

O'Donohue: It sounds like you liked music and dance.

Hastorf:

I had gone to a small high school, and in the afternoon we

would drive around in cars or we would go ice skating. I was

in a sorority. When my mother said we were going to move to New

Jersey, there were lots of tears and lots of exchanges of

fraternity pins and sorority pins and we went off to New Jersey

not looking back because we couldn't bear to.

In the meantime, it was always assumed without question that I would go to college. It didn't matter where. By the time we moved to New Jersey we were thinking about exams and getting ready for the SATs. We took a tour through the colleges and when we arrived at Mt. Holyoke my father really waxed because he had a girl who had gone to Mt. Holyoke and she was perfect. He had been an engineering student at Cornell and my mother had gone to Syracuse in Fine Arts and I knew I couldn't take either one of those schools. So I really had to look elsewhere, and was happy to do that. I got the idea of girls' school in the Seven Sisters. In those days I think it was pretty easy to get into those schools because I made it.

O'Donohue: What kind of career ambitions did you have?

Hastorf:

At that time I was an economics major but the war came

along and took any long-range planning out of everyone's mind

and I had to think of military and volunteer work to help out

the cause. By the time I was a senior I knew I was going to

marry A1 and he was off far away in California and I didn't

know when I was going to see him. So I had a hard time

deciding what to do after that, what kind of a job to take. I

worked in the summers in New York City and I worked for an

insurance company after I graduated until I got married.

O'Donohue: What kind of work did you do?

Hastorf:

Oh, I worked in Wanamakers. Another summer I worked for a

legal/architectural firm.

Webb:

Did you like that kind of work?

Hastorf:

Well, I thought it was pretty menial, but it was above the

filing person.

Webb:

How did A1 get to California?

Hastorf:

He was a corporal in the Air Force and he was stationed

here and there? he spent most of his time in California at an

air base.He was taking tests for navigator's school.

Webb:

Had he been in graduate school at the time?

6

Hastorf:

Yes, he had, but not in that particular field. He had

gone to Harvard the summer after he graduated in History, but

he was pulled out; Uncle Sam pointed his finger at him, and he

got a call and joined up. After we were married I moved to

Minneapolis to go to school there. We got married right after

I graduated in New Jersey. We had a year. [He was selected to

go to the university and he tried every way to get out of

teaching a machine gun at the University of Minnesota military

psychological program, living in a fraternity house, marching

at football games.] When we did get married, I lived at the

other end of the town and I saw him maybe every other weekend

for a night for months and months, there at the fraternity

house. Ridiculous.

O'Donohue: Pretty elegant barracks.

Hastorf:

Well, he had sheets. That was the one thing he really

wanted to do, was that somewhere he wanted sheets so that he

wouldn't have to sleep in army blankets, and the program

provided him with sheets. It was a little different than

people envisage nowadays. We got married and didn't live

together; now people live together and don't get married.

Webb:

I'm sure there were many young people who were in similar circumstances scattered all over the country. And how long did you stay?

7

Hastorf:

I stayed there about a year hoping to catch up with him,

but the time was never right so I ended up going back to New

Jersey to wait it out. Eventually he was transferred to

Langley Field. After he got settled in there I moved down so

we could live together at long last.

O'Donohue: You mentioned the war affecting your college life and certainly the early married years. Can you tell us a little more about the college years?

Hastorf:

It started before Pearl Harbor; that fall, September, many

of the boys we knew at Amherst were drafted and every night a

different one would go off and we'd have a large send-off party

with tears and balloons. Finally came Pearl Harbor and after

that day, those who hadn't already gone in the service were

very restless and eager to sign up. They departed because Tom

or Jim or so-and-so were going to leave on that day so they

would leave the next day. So we would have these little

celebrations all over again--but one would have to cover up

one's sadness with some celebrating and that was hard.

Eventually they all graduated quite early. I think they set graduation about six weeks early. Then they all went off and that was the end of the social life as far as the girls on campus were concerned. We knitted a great deal and we did a

lot of USO work and we entertained fellows at the nearby airbase putting on dances. Some of them were so lonely, from England and they were 18 years old and they were scared and shaking. We tried to cheer them up. We also had a few people vtfio were WACS and WAVES on campus. There were a few courses offered to students in photography and other war-oriented courses. So we really geared ourselves for it one way or another, for the war effort. Some got an automatic commission to the WAVES.

Webb:

Is that something that you thought about doing?

Hastorf:

It was by invitation and I didn't receive an invitation.

O'Donohue: Do you think you might have accepted it?

Hastorf:

Oh, I would have. I would have loved to do that.

O'Donohue: It sounds like all these volunteer activities took the place of some other kinds of traditional college activities.

Hastorf:

Well, we didn't have any regular male contingent around.

Every once in a while one would pass through and if we were old

acquaintances it was always a real treat.

Webb:

Was there a lot of letter-writing at that time?

Hastorf:

Every day--oh yes. We didn't use the telephone very much,

which is quite a contrast. We really did sit down and write

letters. In many ways that is an historical account. I still

have Al's somewhere.

O'Donohue: Does he have yours?

Hastorf:

Oh, I doubt it. He moved around too much.

Webb:

If we can get back to your life with your parents for a bit; did you have grandparents, aunts and uncles that you were involved with?

Hastorf:

We certainly did. We were a really close family and on my

mother's side there was a lot if activity. My grandmother and

grandfather lived about a half mile away. I must admit I

probably stopped in to see them about four times a week. It

was always fun to sit with my grandfather out on the back porch

and get a molasses cookie from my grandmother, and also to

listen to her radio. We all had radios, but she had a special

radio that picked up distant stations, in Chicago and Detroit

and that was thrilling. And I did spend many weekends, in fact

almost every weekend at my grandparents. You might say they

were babysitters for my mother and father. I had a younger

sister. I don't know what they did with her at times like

that. We'd entertain ourselves by playing games such as

pinochle, and they were good sports and played with me.

10

I also had my mother's sister and her husband who had two children. My girl cousin--the boy cousin was older, so we were really very close--spent Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Fourth of July, Labor Day and a few other memorial type days with the family.

Mimi:

What kind of things did the children do?

Hastorf:

Well, I guess you could say we kind of rolled and tumbled

mostly. We didn't do anything special? we were more like puppy

dogs. When I think back, on Thanksgiving when all the

grown-ups were in the house--it wasn't a house any bigger than

where we live right now--it was bursting with activity. When

it wasn't too cold, we'd go out and play, all bundled up.

Inside we'd play on the chairs and in the closets.

Webb:

When the extended family got together, was there any special way in which the holidays were celebrated that are different from the usual tradition?

Hastorf:

I wouldn't say they were different? usually on

Thanksgiving I was in the church choir and we always put on a

singing program in the morning on Thanksgiving day. We'd have

a fire and then we would have the turkey at my grandmother's

house. At Christmas we'd open up the presents on Christmas

morning and oftentimes my father's relatives from New York

would be there.

11

I can remember one time how I really believed in Santa Claus. I was at the top of the stairs and heard my parents. The next morning I went down and there were big steps that came right out of the fireplace made right out of ashes. My father had done that and my mother said , "Oh! my good carpet." Anyway, I really believed that was Santa Claus. They tried really hard to make me believe.

Webb:

With your family, with Al, do you continue some of the traditions?

Hastorf:

We try, but we don't have accessibility to them very

often. We do the best we can to get together, especially at

Christmastime. But we have a daughter up in Juneau, Alaska.

This year was the first year that Al and I have been alone.

Sad.

'Donohue: It brings up the question of how life is different? how your schooling year were different, how family life was different--how would you contrast life for women in general today, women here at Stanford specifically?

Hastorf:

Well, I certainly think most of the ones of my generation

have gone through pretty much the same cycle that I have with

the postwar time when life was segmented because families don't

hang together the way they did before. We have other friends

who feel the same as we do about close family. They have their opportunities now and then.

O'Donohue: Do you feel your daughters will have a very different kind of life than you have had?

Hastorf:

As youngsters I think their life was pretty much the same

as mine, except that we didn't have any relatives close by.

We did things with relatives whenever we could. We don't get

together much because they are scattered.

Webb: [question about her parents]?

Hastorf:

First, I don't think they thought we were going into the

academic world. Secondly, when I married, he was in the

service and that was acceptable? one never questioned that. We

went to Princeton mainly because it was close. There were

other schools that A1 considered, but Princeton seemed to be

the most logical. He could have gone to any one he wanted.

Then when we went to Dartmouth my father said, "Who would want

to go up in that God-forsaken country for, so far away?" But

then he thought, "That is one of the Ivy League schools, so

maybe it's all right." They enjoyed visiting us in the

summer.

I didn't get much editorializing from my family on what I did. I would not say that they were unsupportive nor did they bend over baclkwards.

O'Donohue: They must have been confident that you were doing the right thing.

Hastorf:

Well, they didn't worry about me, let's put it that way.

END OF SIDE ONE

BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO

Webb:

What about earlier, when you were younger--what did you want to do when you grew up.

Hastorf:

I always thought I'd like to be a lawyer, mainly because

I'd always be asking questions and would get the response, "Oh,

she's asking another question, that's what lawyers do." So I

figured that was my slot in life.

Webb:

Did your parents encourage that career?

Hastorf:

No, but they didn't discourage me either. I guess when I

look back, what I got a great of enjoyment from my college

experience was discussing with my father in the evening. (At

that time he was working in New Jersey in his territory, but

his office was in New York City. He loved being in the city) We would spend many nights debating and discussing Communism and the stock market and fascism and the war and Hitler. He liked to argue and my mother would get very upset; she'd go upstairs. It wasn't that it was a violent discussion, but it was excitable. Finally at the end he'd say, "Well, I just wanted to test you, to see what those Communist faculty have taught you. They really didn't turn you into a Communist." So he felt better about my going to Mt. Holyoke, because he had heard tales about it. If you were Communist, you were awful. But I enjoyed those discussions as I look back.

My mother spent most of the time coaching plays, writing plays, little marionnette shows, running the largest church in the city.

'Donohue: Did she ever involve you?

Hastorf:

I was always the one with a sign in front of them for the

Women's Guild before a play she was putting on. I was right

there in the front row and didn't like it. My sister was

really very weak and quite sickly and she was pampered and

taken care of.

Webb:

What kind of expectations did your parents have of you?

Hastorf:

They never told me. They just wanted me to go to college

so that I would have a liberal education that I could always

depend upon if I needed to. They thought it was a good idea

that I got married. They never laid out anything. My mother

wanted me to go to college and study and follow the rules.

O'Donohue: When you began college, were you still thinking at all of law?

Hastorf:

No, I wasn't, I was too busy. There were so many

extra-curricular activities on the campus that I had a hard

time buckling down to my courses and I wanted to try

everything.

Webb:

What were your favorite subjects in high school and grade school?

Hastorf:

I don't know if any were above or below the other. I

wasn't any better at one than I was in another. First I

thought I'd like chemistry best at Mt. Holyoke, but after a

year I decided against that and I took economics. For the first

time in my life I got the best mark in the class on the first

test. There's nothing like that experience to make you feel a

little more devoted to a subject. I thoroughly enjoyed it and

declared Economics as my major, but because of the war my

favorite professor was called off to Washington. I managed to

get through.

16

O'Donohue: You mentioned earlier that you had audited lots of courses here at Stanford. Have any of them followed along those earlier interests?

Hastorf:

I've taken a lot of history and I've continued that. I

had no art at all ever, and I've taken lots of art courses. I

have taken a few in music and English.

O'Donohue: When you look back at some of the earlier things you have done, how do you see yourself developing during this time?

Hastorf:

I think given the challenge, one grabs it. I feel that

all along there have been many challenges that I just didn't

want to let go. This really bothers A1 that I want to go just

one bit farther. I feel that way about what I do. If I see

something I want to do, I want to do it one bit better.

O'Donohue: And what are you thinking about doing now?

Hastorf:

I'm going to be cutting back, mainly because A1 wants to

and now he's upset because he doesn't have me available Friday

afternoons and Monday mornings. So I feel that it's time that

I think about limiting my activities. I don't know how modern

women think that way, but we work better if we work together.

17

O'Donohue: How do you think modern women think?

Hastorf:

I think many of them think about themselves--its the "me"

generation? they're perfectly willing to share, but they think

about themselves first. I think a lot of it is not just

because I want to, but because Al. Back when we were in

Hanover he traveled a great deal. In those days you didn't fly

in and out of Hanover, you took a train. That would take up a

weekend and sometimes it would be every week. That left me

alone with the children so I had a chance to set my own goals

and pace and decide what to do and do it. It's an adjustment

now, the sharing, because with the children I wasn't sharing,

it was a demand.

Webb:

How would you compare your role as a parent to your mother's role?

Hastorf:

Not too different. She spent a lot of time out of the

home and I guess I did too, but I always tried, when the

children were in school, to be home. And she did too. She did

a lot of worrying. She would dabble.

Webb:

How has Al's career in psychology impact on you?

Hastorf:

We'd discuss problems. I don't mean that we'd do what the

textbook says, but I do remember when we first moved in to an

apartment house in Hanover, we had Betsy, and we were on

the third floor. There were eight apartments and each apartment had little children. Betsy would go down and play with the little children and all the parents would watch to see how a psychologist treated that child, which was really quite a shock to me because I didn't think we did anything any different than any other intelligent parent would do.

Webb:

Did you feel that A1 had any set ideas about growing up--was he testing any theories?

Hastorf:

No, he had knowledge but I don't feel that he treated the

kids differently.

Webb:

Did the field of psychology interest you?

Hastorf:

Yes, I had three or four psychology courses and I think

John Gardner of Common Cause was my Psych. One professor. .He

was an idol, a goal.

O'Donohue: Do you think your daughters' education fits them for a different life than you have had?

Hastorf:

They both went to Stanford and got a liberal education. I

think they're pretty well set. Christy has gone on for her PhD

so that she's a specialist. But Betsy, the older one, seems to

be doing well in sociology, economics and education. I'd say

they profited very happily from their education.

19

O'Donohue: Did you encourage them specifically or did you have the same sort of "hands off" policy as your parents?

Hastorf:

You mean for going to Stanford or any decision role?

0'Donohue: In the decision making.

Hastorf:

Well, they pretty much did what they thought what they

wanted to do. I guess I must say I questioned them a little

bit, and Al did too.

0'Donohue: You weren't guiding them in a special way?

Hastorf:

No, they were independent.

Webb:

How do you see your education before college?

Hastorf:

It was kind of curious. Where I went to high school was

one of the good schools in northern New Jersey. When I look

back at my graduating class of about 600, most of the women who

graduated either got married or did menial jobs. Many of them

went to a "finishing school" to be a secretary and I don't

think more than five of us went to an accredited college. It

was an upper class community and I've always been a little

shocked at that. I don't think many were serious about

pursuing an academic education. The counseling system

was, I thought, pretty poor. So I thought it was pretty shocking.

O'Donohue: What do you think about education for women today?

Hastorf:

Now that is a good question because I happen to be very

involved in working with Mt. Holyoke. Over the years I've done

a good deal of interviewing peninsula students for Mt. Holyoke

and I've done fundraising and I am certainly 100% behind women

getting an education. They should not settle for something

less than the best. I just happen to think it's very important

that women be treated fairly, evenly, and get the best

education anybody could possibly have. I fight for it.

O'Donohue: This is not a new idea for you.

Hastorf:

No, but in my family, my mother went to college and the

thought of a woman not going to college or being deprived of

going to college is shocking, or that she didn't have parental

backing. I guess also I feel very happy that I did what I did

and I never felt aware that I was a second-class citizen. I

think that at some larger universities where women feel second

class and have to sit in the back or don't raise their hands--I

just realized it was a real put-down for women.

O'Donohue: Do you think that has changed at universities like Stanford?

Hastorf:

I don't think Stanford is quite in that category. It does

take a positive woman to make it through Stanford, getting in

seminars. I don't think that's a sexist situation at Stanford.

But I do know some of the girls are aggressive and they will

search out a professor.

Webb:

Do you always think it's been that way at Stanford?

Hastorf:

Yes, I think it has been. The student body hasn't grown

any and the faculty certainly hasn't diminished, so that

equilibrium has always been maintained so that the faculty is

available. I think the Freshman advisors make a much closer

contact with the Freshmen and they are matching up more

advantageously the students with the faculty. That is all for

the best, in learning how to deal with the faculty. They're

people.

O'Donohue: Have you been involved in anything like that here at Stanford?

Hastorf:

We've had students this year and we've had them in the

past. This year it looks like a lot better, more flexible

student. Although one student had a golf teacher as an advisor

and that was a shame, because he was no help to her and she was

no help to him either.

Webb:

You and A1 are advisors?

Hastorf:

Yes.

Webb:

How often do you meet?

Hastorf:

They've been here a few times. A1 sees them about once

every three weeks for dinner and for lunch about once a month.

O'Donohue: How many people participate in that program, do you know?

Hastorf:

I don't know, but there are enough to go around.

O'Donohue: And it has been a program in place for a long time?

Hastorf:

It has been in place, but somehow the management is more

carefully thought out this year.

O'Dononue: To whom or to what do you credit that?

Hastorf:

I think the new Dean of Undergraduate Studies--[Carolyn

SOHP Interview with Barbara Hastorf Interview 3, May 16, 1986

Webb:

Earlier, Barbara, in other interviews, you made a passing reference to Boy's Town and we didn't expand on it at that time. Would you like to expand on that a little now? What it is, what was Al's role and how you were involved?

Hastorf: Well, Boy's Town came about in connection with Stanford University at a time when the Boy's Town in Iowa had their board of trustees decide they had too much money in the bank and that they really had to put some of it out for a useful purpose. They decided, at that point, that a useful purpose would be to expend it on research rather than on actually taking care of boys and orphans. Boy's Town at this town did not have any orphans, it had boys that were referred through the courts because there were no orphan boys. It was set up at one time when men went off to war or parents went west or other problems happened and there were children left orphaned. But because of this the boys were really problem children who were at the mercy of the courts.

They came from all over the country. With this in mind the managers of Boy's Town, or the trustees, looked around the
country. They found one place on the east coast where they decided they could set up a research lab. That was at Catholic University. They had a research lab connected with Boy's Town and for the west coast, after combing all the

2

possible sites, they chose Stanford because of the hospital,

its pediatrics, its psychiatric situation. They found this

exactely what they

wanted. So they offered Stanford a large

sum of money to set

up a research institute using the

faculty; not hiring new faculty, but using the present

faculty.

So with a little working they found space. They bought a statute that was the logo for Boy's Town, you carry your small brother on your shoulder. They had a few of those scattered throughout the campus. They redid one of the buildings of the outer quad for Boy's Town headquarters and it was set up. A1 became at one point director. I can't remember how many faculty -- I think he must have involved about 10 or 12 faculty members working part time with Bey's Town. It was a "buy-out" situation where they were bought out from their other departments at that time, in research on juvenile problems.

As they looked at this they decided girls were as important as boys and so they did extensive research on children. Within a few years they discovered it wasn't children alone--they didn't live on an island by themselves. It was families that were the major concern. So they focused, as of today, their focus as of now is on family situations rather than on just children. Boy's Town, after a few--oh, there was a grand opening and the Bishop came and the head of Boy's Town came out. There were speeches all day long opening up this new building.

Within a few years the new trustees of Boy's Town decided they didn't like what was going on at Stanford, so they went into the courts and they wanted the money back. Right now it has been settled. It is not called Boy's Town any more, but is called Center for Youth and Family Development. The directorship has changed a number of times but A1 actually was in on the formation. That was really very interesting, to explore these problems, at least for me, on the outside, to watch them explore these problems together as a team, rather than individually as an expert in child behavior or as an expert in some physical damage that happens in young babies. They put this all together into one package, which was much more beneficial, listening to their colleagues talk about their problems and incorporating them.
Every week they had a seminar and it was on a different problem which each person from every discipline came. It was very broadening. Mike Wold now is the Director of it. It has expanded out into not only care, but into the legal field of the juveniles in foster homes--the best way to solve problems children with the community and also with their families. I guess that's really about it. A1 was in it for about 3 years.
O'Donohue: Who is funding it now? Is there still a connection with Boy's Town?

Hastorf: There is still some money, I think Boy's Town money runs out within the next year. But there are many other foundations supporting it now. Each professor involved has his own grant.
O'Donohue: Something else you mentioned earlier, Barbara, was that each of the overseas experiences was a story in itself. Can you tell us a little about that?
Hastorf: I certainly found that it was an extremely enriching experience in my life and certainly the students' too. I'm not sure what I told you last time, so I'm not quite sure what to include in my recollections of the overseas campuses. But when I look back we were pioneers, and that was fun in itself. We were right in on the opening of the campus in Austria and we were also, some years later, in on the opening of the Clivedon campus in England. It was Austria two quarters once and one quarter in England. Austria preceded it. Many of the studetnt whom we met at that time we have had close relationships with, sort of like an extended family. It seems like for the most part whenever any of them--many of them--come back to Stanford, they stop in to see us or spend the night or tell us of their woes or their good experiences too.

5
Some have lived over our garage, which has put them right into the family circle. We've had weddings, we've had pre-wedding parties. We've put up families. Al has been best man. We really have involved ourselves with these students. I think that was probably one of the students' most valuable experiences at Stanford too. So many of them were really very shy when they would arrive at an overseas campus, thinking that they were going to automatically be able to fit into local surroundings. In fact there was one--maybe I told you this earlier--but one young man we hand't seen until two weeks before the quarter was over. His name was on the list and I finally matched him up with his name as we were waiting in like to go to dinner one day. I inquired where he had been and he said he slept all day. That meant that he missed all his classes all day and what he did all night, goodness knows. We were out in the country. He had no car. No one does know what he did. He had no friends. He didn't seem to be unhappy. Anyway, I met him back here--which I did later on on the campus--it was my long lost friend. I hardly knew him at all, but we were friends getting back home.
I think being overseas for these studetns at that particular period in their life was a really traumatic experience and our BMQCs (Big Men on Campus), or very important people back home, they are deflated in an overseas situation. I think maybe students today react a little more differently. They seem to be a little more savvy. But many

of these students who went came from the valley, Billings, Montana or Fresno. They had never been out of their local environment and suddenly to be in an overseas situation in a foreign environment where you can't speak the language and you find out that people do things differently, they order different things in the grocery store and food is served in a different fashion and to get on a trolley or a tram you do it differently than you did at home--there was really a lot of learning experiences in a short period of time, which in the end paid off for these students. But they kind of suffer along the way.
O'Donohue: What about your role? Was the role overseas different for a faculty wife?
Hastorf: You live in the same building with the students, at least at that time you did. I think the campuses are arragned a little differently now. We had eighty students in the building with us and we were very close: breakfast, lunch and dinner together and then we divided the group up and had them in our room two or three times a week in the evening to have gab sessions or discuss a problem or an intellectual discussion. I loved having them there because, especially in Austria, I never did learn the language. The students were supposed to get out and speak German. So if I ever needed anything, I would sidle up to some attractive student who seemed to want to practice the language and we'd go shopping

or to a museum or accomplish whatever errand I really thought I wanted to do that day. That's a great bond of friendship, helping each other. So I felt I could help them and they in turn helped me ten-fold.

O'Donohue: What was the transition like when you came back to Stanford?

Hastorf: I don't mean to be all that callous, but it's easy to come back home. I think the students had a much larger transition than I did. Actually, when we were there the first time, we got there at Christmas time and didn't get back home until September. We spent the summer, A1 had a few projects--we went to England, Scotland where he did same lecturing and in Yugoslavia--forget it. And then back into France. So we were traveling a great deal, so it was just wonderful to get back home again. I don't think it was a transition, but it was comfort.

Webb:

You spoke also about the different administrations, at one time, at campus--the style or the atmosphere for students. I think we talked somewhat about the Lyman administration. I don't know about the Kennedy administration--for some years and also overlapped the time when A1 was Provost.

Hastorf: They both happened at the same time. Don Kennedy came back to the campus as provost a year before he came President. Then when he was asked to become President he asked A1 if he'd be his provost. So that was simultaneous, the two of them went into the new office (s) together. Al's feeling was, he and Don had worked together on the Human Biology program way back when it began. There were four or five of them Who were the instigators of that popular major. Having worked with him there, he had close relations with him ever since and it seemed like a good team. He felt he wanted to help Don. So we moved into the Hanna House the year after A1 became provost, because the Kennedys stayed on a year while they renoved the Hoover House, made it liveable for them.
Al first went in as for just a year, but then the committee, after the search was over, asked him if he'd be provost. He did a bit reluctantly. He really did not want to be an administrator. The story was--speaking of administration--when he was at Dartmouth, he was chairman of the department and he told all the folks at Dartmouth the reason he was leaving to come to Stanford was that he didn't want to be an administrator. So when we go back to Hanover, New Hampshire, which we do every three or four years, that's the first thing we hear, "So, you didn't want to be an administrator." He's really fought it, although he does it. He has struggles with himself about it, which I always think is rather amusing.

9
What else do you want to know about the Kennedy administration? He really got started with a bang. It was a real honeymoon. Mimi will perhaps remember the marvelous party that was given by the President for the whole community--actually the trustees presented the party to the ODmmunity. The staff and the faculty. There were three bands, a waltz band, a jazz band and another one.
O'Donohue: Was it on campus?
Hastorf: Yes, in Roble gym. A large buffet of food. So there was something for everybody. Everybody thought we ought to do this every year because the spirits were very behind this. They thought it was wonderful. But it hasn't happened again. But at least the administration got started on a high key.
O'Donohue: Has it kept that momentum, do you feel?
Hastorf: Well, it's had its trials and tribulations, which happen as you grind out the years and grind out the administrations. I like to think that it still has popular support of a favorable nature. Right now I'm not in the middle of it, so I really can't report on that.
O'Donohue: When you were at Hanna House, were you more in the middle of it?

10

Hastorf: Yes, I would certainly say I was in the middle of it. It was interesting because I did have a chance to meet so many people on the faculty, and also so many important donors and people who cared about Stanford University on the outside. Those were really the constituencies that seemed to cross my path as they crossed the doors or the thresholds of the Hanna Honeycomb house.

Webb:

You were really a hostess, a special hostess, because you were running a University official residence there, wouldn't you say?

Hastorf: I'd like to think that was the way it was. Yes. The house was a University house and I did deal daily with the running of the house. When we first moved in it needed a lot of work and repair and just touching up and TLC to get it into a more liveable situation. The Kennedy's had done a great deal, but their focus was on the other house, which was much larger in dimensions and took a lot more of their interests and their time. So when I got in we had workmen around every day and I had a person whom I met with from Operations and Maintenance once a week and it usually took all morning to go over what had been done adn what needed to be done in the next week, and outlining what needed to be done in the long run in the house. So I spent a lot of time doing that.

Webb:

So that was the role of a house manager. What about your

role as a hostess?

Hastorf: We always felt that it was important that if anybody was coming to visit the house, of an official nature, to be on hand as the host or hostess. We never did go away and say, "If you want a party, have it and have a good time." I guess we both felt it was important that we be there to recieve people.

Webb:

As a hostess, you must have spent a lot of time planning social events.

Hastorf: I went through every guest list, what the invitation would look like, read like, who would do the flowers, who would do the catering, where the tables would sit, what color the tableclothes, where all the silver and plates would come from and how many people would be serving and where to park the cars and who would be the bar tender and how many bar tenders--yes.

Webb:

You also hosted some famous people. You mentioned relations with donors. You became very involved with donors when you lived in the house. You also hosted some famous people.

12
Hastorf: We did. We had the King of Sweden--that was a real whirlwind tour. He was due at 8:30 in the morning. He was visiting Stanford the day and Silicon Valley the next day. As it turned out, he had a dinner in the city the night before, but he did like discos. About 11:30 that night he got his aide and a few other people in his party to go with him to a disco, which he must have returned home from at 3 or 4 in the morning. He didn't like to get up early in the morning, but he had to be at our house at 8:30. So he zipped down the highway with all these sirens going and the patrol in front and in back. He arrived at the house. I do think that he was really rather sleepy. On top of that, it rained very hard that night and it was just dripping just up until the moment he came. We were sweeping off the pavement and the terraces. Ihe camera people were there under their umbrella and everybody was lined up to greet him.
But the one marvelous thing that happened, and I don't think he realized it until after the day was over. We did manage to get ten of the Nobel Prize winners from the Stanford campus to appear with their wives for brunch. They were all dressed up and they were all so proud and they lined up. I got to introduce him to each and every one of them. That was a real thrill. He shook their hands. He didn't say anything to any one of them, although he could speak English very well. I just think he was just overwhelmed with what went on and I don't believe he had been warned ahead of time that that

13
was going to be his reception when he got out of his automobile. At any rate, he sat on this couch, right here, in the Hanna House, and I sat next to him for a while. A1 was very helpful and brought around one after the other the Nobel winners to sit on the other side so that he had a chance to talk with him and they had a chance to ask him questions.
When his plate was brought to him he looked at it as he sat on the couch, saying, "Is this where I'm going to eat it?" I said, "Yes, this was informal, because there were so many people here," He didn't eat very much. There was too much going on for him to really make a meal of that huge plateful of goodies. The whole thing lasted I think 50 minutes. So you see, it was a whirlwind experience. That was his visit.
We also twice had the crown prince of Belgium, his wife, his son, his daughter. His son was matriculating as a masters degree student at the first visit, so this was Stanford's way of saying, "We're delighted that you're considering Stanford." The second time was part way through his two year program when his family came to visit him on an unofficial visit. They came with a few people whom he had met or were important to him while he was on the campus. That was interesting.

14

Webb:

Are there any other events that come to mind about life in the Hanna House?

Hastorf: Well, there's one that's kind of amusing. It pertains to a piano that was donated to the house by an elderly Stanford graduate. He requested that Brahms Quartet with piano solo be played every year on this piano. That is a terrific tour de force to get five experts to plays Brahms most difficult composition. I finally did arrange that the Stanford String Quartet would play it with Jody Gadalphy as the pianist. Our donor from Los Angeles was delighted to come up for this Sunday afternoon musicale. So I had the piano tuned and the man was banging away at the piano one morning, it was a bright, sunny, warm morning and the doors and windows were open. The phone rang and a close friend of mine called and said, "I'm asking you a favor. I have Admiral Rickover visiting me and I would like to entertain him this morning by showing him the Hanna Honecomb House. May I bring him over?" I said, "Well of course you can, but the piano's being tuned right now." She said, "We don't mind at all." Within about five minutes, the piano was piink-plinking along and they arrived at the door and walked in. Admiral Rickover walked right in, walked right up to the piano and I said to the man tuning it, "Excuse me sir, I would like you to meet Admiral Rickover, who is visiting us for a few minutes." He stood up and he shook his hand and Admiral Rickover grilled him on how long it took him to learn to tune a piano, can I tune a piano

15

too, do I have to put much time in it, what special talents do I have to have? And this poor fellow, all he could do was go "Yes" and "No" and "Err..."

I finally decided the best thing to do was to move Admiral Rickover into another room where we could talk about something else. It was once again a whirlwind visit, but when he left I went back to the piano tuner and I said, "Did you realize who I introduced you to?" He said, "Yes, Admiral Rickover." I said, "I guess that doesn't happen every day." He said, "Oh Lord, no." At any rate, that was one of the typical things that happened in that house. All sorts of crazy, outlandish, off-the-wall kind of events took place.

Webb:

How did you cope with running an official university residence? Did anything prepare you for this? Did anybody teach you how to do that?

Hastorf: I don't know if one teaches. I guess I learned on the job, is about all I can say, with the help of the wonderful staff in the office and many helpers over at Buildings and Grounds or O[perations] and Maintenance] I should call it.

Webb:

How did you balance that life with your private life?

Hastorf: I decided--I did quite a bit at that time, in fact, on my own I perhaps did more than I had the strength to do. I was on the Committee for Art board, and also, when I was on that board, I was on the finance committee. We discovered that the Gallery Bookshop needed a new manager, needed overhauling. I was appointed chairman of that, for that year--one of the years I was there--I tried to manage the Gallery Bookshop with the help of two gentlemen and we hired a woman who, unfortunately, didn't turn out to be very successful. So there was a lot of grief over severing that relationship and the bookshop was kind of in bad shape at the end of that. So I had all that and also I was on the Music Guild board at the same time. I was busy with them putting on musicales.
So I would say that I have enough private life mixed in. Oar children weren't home, but every once in a while they would came and visit and that always created a house full of them and all their friends. So there was private life even though it was a public, official residence. We did try to carve out what time we could to do what we needed to do for ourselves.
O'Donohue: Have there been special people that you particularly enjoyed working with during the years?
Hastorf: You're referring to Stanford people?

17
O'Donohue: Stanford or some of these volunteer projects that you've done.
Hastorf: Well, I think I have many Stanford colleagues that I'm really very fond of who have been so helpful and we enjoy each other. One in particular is Noel Kolak in the Provost's office and Joan Parker. She was Al's secretary. I enjoyed also by and large a group that was formed--this is an interesting group too, it was formed back when Dick Lyman was the President. He decided that he should have a hostel out in the country with all the Dean's present for a weekend to discuss Deans' problems so one would know what the other one was concerned with and how their budgets were and their faculty.
One woman couldn't go so she decided that she wanted--the wives were invited to--to find out what went on and what it was like, and so she got all of us wives together. That, curiously enough, continued. It's sort of "half-life" now, but it did meet once a month for a brown bag lunch.
END OF SIDE ONE
BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO
O'Donohue: You began to meet once a month to discuss common interests....

18
Hastorf: And to became better acquainted. It is very difficult when you are at these official functions and all the Deans and their wives are there with the guests of honor, to have any really time to find out what your counterparts in other departments are like. So it really was very important, I thought, to have this extra time so that we could have better understanding of each other. Anyway, I think it still goes on. When Al was the Provost I kept the organization going, which I felt was important and Jeanne Kennedy and I worked it out. She was very busy but certainly supportive. I think she was glad to have me make sure that it stayed alive.
Once a year we also had our husbands for a potluck supper. That turned out to be fun, because that's a group that never really gets together on its own. It's always with other important business functions going on.
O'Donohue: You learned a lot, then, from each other. Do you think that you ever had a particular role model in the course of being a faculty wife, an official's wife and so forth?
Hastorf: Well, I really right now can't think of any one. I think I just looked at my colleagues and predecessors, many of them have been so helpful that I think I've taken a little bit from several. Right now I can't really go into naming whom.

19
O'Donohue: Do you think you've ever been a role model?
Hastorf: Oh, not that I know of.
O'Donohue: No one has told you.
Hastorf: Well, no, not specifically.
O'Donohue: Is your life anything like you imagined it would be?
Hastorf: Back when I was where, or when?
O'Donohue: Well, maybe that concept changed at different times. Did it? From early childhood to young womanhood?
Hastorf: I think I never dreamed I would be living in California and also having lived in Frank Lloyd house with A1 as a Provost. Once in a while I would pinch myself and say, "What's this girl from New Jersey doing here?" However, I don't think I had aspirations. I guess what I thought of was as long as A1 is happy doing what he's doing, I'll go along as a support as best I can. I think the only time there was a lack of support on my part or the children's part, was our moving for California for good. He did not have much home backing on that move. But once we got here, that was bygone history.

20

O'Donohue: Was that one of the most difficult things you ever had to do, to make that move?

Hastorf: lhat was probably one of the more difficult. I'm afraid that maybe I don't move very readily or easily. I think that's probably the basis of it. I like things as they are.

Webb:

It sounds as though you are adaptable, that you fit in

wherever you are and whatever the role is.

Hastorf: Right. I try.

Webb:

Have you made suggestions to A1 over the years about

various aspects of life?

Hastorf: You mean about wearing the proper tie when he goes out in the morning? Oh, I guess I feel that we're really very close and things that are on his mind, we talk about. It's not that I suggest, it's just input. I don't know how else to say it. If I ask him if he'd do something, he usually does it, but for something more major--he doesn't ask my opinion on major decisions of the University. I might editorialize a little bit, but he knows pretty much what he has in his own mind.

Webb:

Have you ever been directly involved in his research and

writing?

21

Hastorf: I'm not a very good typist, but I have typed. I did teach him how to pass his French exam when he was in graduate school. I've tried to learn the computer, but I haven't quite made that yet. Yes, I worked for him way back when we first moved to Stanford. I was a statistician on some of his collating on his research. I am right now working for the Terman Gifted. So, whether you say working for him--yes, I'm working on a project he's working on.

Webb:

Have you ever been involved in any controversial issues

that A1 was dealing with?

Hastorf: I guess when he was Provost, yes. There were many times when I felt --right now I can't think what they are--but he would say this is conflict of interest and you should get out. Chances are I didn't get out. I didn't stir up too many waves.

Webb:

How has A1 shared in some of your activities?

Hastorf: He's helpful. He won't play tennis with me, but he's a supporter. I do a lot of work for Mt. Holyoke and he does support me there. We went up to the city for lunch the other day and he very nicely and graciously went along when the President came to the city. I would just say that when called upon he will give a talk or whatever I want him to do for the event.

22

Webb:

Just a few minutes ago you said that sometimes he said that there was a conflict of interest there. I want to know more about hew your activities might have conflicted with his.

Hastorf: Well, it was mainly when I was on the board of the Committee for Art or for the Music Guild when they would really like something done and I'm sure the reason I was there was because they felt I was a pipeline to getting it done. A1 would get a little bit annoyed because it was counter to what he was working for.

Webb:

Can you provide any specific examples?

Hastorf: I'm trying hard to think. It had to do with, I guess a lot of it had to do with being on the finance committee for the Committee for Art and soliciting donors through the Committee for Art rather than going through the Development Office. There are certain protocols that the Development Office has established for ways of reaching out to the public and they want sole priority on how to do this. These ancillary groups also are doing that. That is, they are combatting each other. I think that's the essence of where the problem lay.

Webb:

So how did this conflict of interest affect your

involvement with the organizations that you were working with?

23
Hastorf: I would try and clarify the University's position, and that's really about all I could do.
0'Donohue: That brings up a question about the Stanford community and the community at large around us, Menlo Park, Palo Alto and so on. Do you perceive any distinction between the two groups, hew the people in the two cammunities--are they separate, do they have common interests?
Hastorf: You mean the University community as opposed to the outside community?
0'Donohue: Yes.
Hastorf: Yes, I think they're quite different. I guess, I think the outside community is certainly intelligent, but I just have the feeling that they don't always, unless they're really involved with Stanford, see Stanford's point of view on many issues.
0'Donohue: Do you find different roles for women at the two places, women who are active in the Stanford community, women who are active in the surrounding community?

Hastorf: Most everything that I'm active in has to do with Stanford, although there are many coraraunity people involved in Stanford activities, like in the hospital or in the Committee for Art, or in the Music Guild or in the Friends of the Historical Society. But as far as--I was in the Garden Club for a while, but that wasn't political at all. That was really about "how does your garden grow" and how to grow a better bonsai, or an orchid greenhouse. I did all those things too.
So I guess the only people I really meet on the outside community are people who feel that Stanford is part of their life. They're certainly critical of a lot of what Stanford does, but when you get down to it, most of them are supportive. Though I must say, every once in a while when you get off in the hinterlands somewhere and you say you're from Stanford, you hear, "Well, I went to Stanford and I'm not giving them one more penny." And then they give you about 1/2 hour lecture on all the weaknesses that Stanford has or they didn't accept their child who was #1 in the class. But there's not much you can do to argue with them, just listen and say, "That's too bad."
O'Donohue: In terms of students and in terms of education in general, what about your own fellow students at Mt. Holyoke. Have some of them led the same kinds of lives that you have, or have there been differences.?

25

Hastorf: A number of them have. It's an interesting school because it's not what one would call a terribly wealthy school or a socially conscious school. So you do have--it was set up for missionaries and teachers. That whole picture does still prevail in a subtle way. I find them compatible.

O'Donohue: Do you find differences in women graduates at Mt. Holyoke as compared to Stanford graduates or those from other public universities?

Hastorf: I'd like to think there's some difference. I just feel that I had an enlightened experience and I think other people do to. I was talking with Cathy Milton here on the campus. She went to Mt. Holyoke. She said that her experiences at Mt. Holyoke were one of the greatest period of her life because she felt the world was her oyster and there was just so much of excitement and interesting faculty and projects and problems to discover that she never felt that she was held back in any way. I have that feeling. I just hope--I don't know that's unique, but I do think it's probably unique than someone who is at a large university.

Webb:

Can you tell us what some of your Mt. Holyoke classmates

have done? Are you still in contact with some of them?

Hastorf: I am. Not too many classmates mainly. My freshman year roomate I never really heard much from after the freshman year. My sophomore year roomate came from the same town as me. She died about 15 years ago of cancer. My best friend also has gone with cancer. My senior roomate, whose family I lived with in Minneapolis, she's gone with cancer. So, to get down to my close friends, I don't have any.

Webb:

What did they do?

Hastorf: One of them was a mother. The other was a schoolteacher. Another was a mother. Another worked in a private school.

O'Donohue: Do you have a philosophy about what the role of an educated person is?

Hastorf: Well, are you thinking of an educated woman or an educated person in particular, or do you want to put it all together?

O'Donohue: I think both of those.

Hastorf: I think, certainly an educated person ought to live up to his potential; live a good life. By that I mean a straightforward, helping others, keeping healthy mentally and physically, all the good things of life are what one should aspire for.

27
O'Donohue: Do you think that role is the same as it always has been?
Hastorf: Well, yes, I think it is, but I don't think everybody treats it that way.
O'Donohue: Is it different for an educated woman?
Hastorf: I think she may be hampered somewhat from what her early goals would be and what she really can accomplish. I think a woman has to go more than 50% of the way to get to where she really wants to be, if you're talking about the world of commerce, assertiveness, a profession. I must say these are things that are sort of built in and I don't spend a lot of time thinking about the "good life" or planning. I kind of take it as it comes and look at that as the way life is going to be.
O'Donohue: But you value your own education.
Hastorf: I do. There are times when I thought that maybe I should have gone on for more, but the war was one and it was so uncertain and then I decided there were other things I was more interested in, and that was--at the time--being married, having a family, picking up little things on the outside to keep interest up, which I've done all along.

28

O'Donohue: So many of the organizations, too, have involved women, particularly the wives of faculty. Have you worked here at Stanford with any of the women faculty.

Hastorf: The Stanford Faculty Women's Club in particular? Yes, I've put in my time with their board of directors.

Webb:

The Stanford Faculty Women's Club, is that for faculty

wives or faculty women?

Hastorf: Well, faculty women, wives and women [faculty]. But I don't think many women faculty take a very active part in Stanford Faculty Women's Club because they have other more pressing deeds to do during the day.

Webb:

What kind of interaction have you observed between

faculty women and faculty wives?

Hastorf: One woman who was on the faculty said to me at one time, and I have not forgotten it, and I found it rather cutting, she reported that a couple that we all know was divorced. The husband was on the faculty and the wife was not. I don't know what she did, I can't remember now. She said, "Isn't it funny that when they became separated, and we were close friends of them, which one did we follow up and continue our friendship with? We followed up with the Professor because his life was

so much more interesting than hers." I thought, "Oh, that is pathetic."

So that's just an anecdote. I don't know what else I can say.

Webb:

What kind of advice would you like to give to another

faculty wife, as a new faculty wife just starting out?

Hastorf: I guess to try, if possible, to have a family and enjoy them? keep in touch with activities on the campus, because that's of interest to you and your husband, and it makes you more alert? support your husband and he hopefully will give equal time to you.

Webb:

Barbara, every role has its frustrations. What were some

of yours?

Hastorf: Oh, in the early days, to have supper on the table when there were so many things going on on campus between 5:30 and 8 with the children at home, hoping that we could all sit down to the table once in a while together.

Webb:

What have been some of the satisfactions?

Hastorf: I think the intellectual life is highly satisfactory and the vast wealth and treasures that the people here at Stanford--and I'm sure at other Universities too--the acquaintance with such a wide variety of interesting people.

30

Webb:

Is there any specific person...?

Hastorf: I don't think I could mention any. There have been too many. I like everybody, for that matter. Once in a while at a dinner party you find somebody sitting next to you and it's like pulling teeth to get a conversation going, but for the most part, they're all good "Chatty Cathys" having a pleasant time and good conversation.

0'Donohue: What have been some of the fun experiences. The last time you said you'd like to talk about some of the fun experiences.

Hastorf: I wish I could think of some of them, when you left the other day.

0'Donohue: I think they had to do with travel.

Hastorf: We've had some marvelous trips. Al had some time off and through the State Department he attended a two-weeks conference in Delhi and it was when India just recently opened up to allowing Americans for confernces and consultations. They were very angry at the U.S. until them. Moynihan was ambassador and he made great strides in cementing relationships between India and the United States. So we went over to this conference, which was a fantastic conference with

31

interesting experts from the U.S. After the conference was over, various institutions around India wanted A1 to pay a visit. The airlines were on strike so the Indian government arranged for us to have a driver and drove us for a week all around India. That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. We saw Accra, the Taj Mahal when the moon was full. We traveled their main highway, which would be like our Highway 1 one whole day and never saw one automobile on it. We were really kind of far away from the big cities.

We finally came to one city called Amanabad, which we had never heard of before and it happened to have a population of 3 million people. So it just shows how really extensive their population is and what little we really know about most of India including the big cities and the interior. It was a big surprise. That was exciting.

Then we went on to Burma and that had only recently been opened in the past 6 months to Americans.

Webb:

Do you remember which year that was?

Hastorf: It was in the mid-seventies. Then we went to China last year, which I adored. That was a month's trip. Of course, having a daughter live in Alaska has taken us up there more than once, and then having another daughter who is an archaeologist I've been there a couple times, digging. I loved that experience.

32

Webb:

Where had that been?

Hastorf: We were up in the highlands of Peru, about 6 hours in from the coast, at a very high altitude. We had a whole fortnight traveling around Peru on the Amazon, Machapichu, down to TakTa and into La Paz, Bolivia. It was thrilling all along because they kept saying, "They're holding American hostages in Bolivia," as our train was approaching the border. Should we stop and go back or should we persevere? But it was over the holidays and it turns out that Revolutionaries are not really revolutionary during holidays, so we got in and out perfectly safely, although people before us and after were detained for some time, for some weeks.

That was exciting. Then we had been to New Zealand and Australia a few times.

Webb:

Were they Stanford-related trips?

Hastorf: No, A1 was doing some teaching.
O'Donohue: Is there anything that you wanted to talk about that we haven't asked you?

Hastorf: No, but I will tell you some really great news that I'm really proud of and that is that Christy, our daughter, has been invited to this Behavioral Science Center next year. Isn't that fantastic? Her father's buttons are just bursting on his shirt, he can hardly contain herself.

O'Donohue: What about her mother's buttons?

Hastorf: I'm excited because she is going to be around here. Now we just have to cross our fingers and hope that her department chairman will give her time. That's the only obstacle. But if he doesn't, he's an old ogre. No department chairman could deprive a budding anthropologist of going to that center.

Webb:

We didn't talk about any of the difficult times, really. There must have been some difficult times somewhere along the way.

Hastorf: You mean life is not a bowl of cherries?

Webb:

Were there any very difficult times?

Hastorf: Not really. Sure there are difficulties, but that makes the good times better, really. I just feel that Al and I have always managed to get along comfortably and that has avoided a lot of pitfalls. Difficult times, I guess the most difficult time was back in the early 70s when Stanford was in such a

state of uproar and the drug scene was just arriving and everything was being turned topsy-turvy for the students. I found that really difficult. I didn't enjoy that at all, especially as it affected our children. They came out of their difficult period, but I felt they were products of this difficult time. That was difficult.

Webb:

How did you deal with that?

Hastorf: Time. I think that's all I can say. Time. There's not much you can do, really, not much that we could do except let them know what we felt and expected them to make their own decisiosn.

Webb:

You're referring to your own girls. What kept you going,

what gave you strength during those times?

Hastorf: You just knew that you had to face tomorrow, even though you didn't sleep all night.

Webb:

Have you ever kept a diary or a journal?

Hastorf: I did for the first six or eight months in the Hanna Honeycomb House, but I've never opened it up to go back and look at it.

Webb:

Have you kept any records systematically?

35

Hastorf: Just the date book.

Webb:

A calendar. And have you kept it over the years, so at the end of the year you do not dispose of the previous year's calendar.

Hastorf: No, I keep stacks.

Webb:

Do you ever go back through them and look....
