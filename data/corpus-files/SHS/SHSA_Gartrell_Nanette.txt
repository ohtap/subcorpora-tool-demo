Introduction
This oral history was conducted by the Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program in
collaboration with the Stanford University Archives. The program is under the direction of
the Oral History Committee of the Stanford Historical Society.
The Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program furthers the Society’s mission “to
foster and support the documentation, study, publication, dissemination, and preservation of
the history of the Leland Stanford Junior University.” The program explores the institutional
history of the University, with an emphasis on the transformative post-WWII period,
through interviews with leading faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and others. The interview
recordings and transcripts provide valuable additions to the existing collection of written and
photographic materials in the Stanford University Archives.
Oral history is not a final, verified, or complete narrative of events. It is a unique, reflective,
spoken account, offered by the interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it may be
deeply personal. Each oral history is a reflection of the past as the interviewee remembers
and recounts it. But memory and meaning vary from person to person; others may recall
events differently. Used as primary source material, any one oral history will be compared
with and evaluated in light of other evidence, such as contemporary texts and other oral
histories, in arriving at an interpretation of the past. Although the interviewees have a past or
current connection with Stanford University, they are not speaking as representatives of the
University.
Each transcript is edited by program staff and by the interviewee for grammar, syntax, and
occasional inaccuracies and to aid in overall clarity and readability--but is not fact-checked as
such. The approach is to maintain the substantive content of the interview as well as the
interviewee’s voice. As a result of this editing process, the transcript may not match the
recording verbatim. If a substantive deletion has been made, this is generally indicated at the
relevant place on the transcript. Substantive additions are noted in brackets or by footnote.

Abstract and Topics
In this oral history, psychiatrist, researcher, and author Nanette Gartrell (BA Human Biology
1972) discusses her family and educational background and traces the trajectory of a career
devoted to overturning stereotypes and scientific misconceptions about homosexuality,
providing non-homophobic healthcare, and preventing sexual misconduct by physicians.
Topics include the ramifications of her personal experience of sexual abuse as a child; the
emergence of her identity as a lesbian; Stanford student life in the late 1960s, including the
meeting of the first organized campus group of lesbians; lesbian communities in Davis,
California, and Washington, DC; and the women’s music cultural movement. Gartrell also
highlights her work on various APA taskforces related to women and/or sexuality; the
organizations Dyke Docs and Women in Medicine; her efforts to ensure the profession
treated sexual abuse of patients by psychiatrists as a serious ethical violation; and the
National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study, an investigation of American lesbian mothers
and their children.

Nanette Kathryn Gartrell, MD
Biography
Nanette Gartrell, MD, is a psychiatrist, researcher, and writer who was a member of
Stanford’s class of 1971. She began her research career in 1971 under the supervision of
Keith Brodie, MD, then a Human Biology professor and later a president of Duke
University. Dr. Gartrell’s first studies focused on psychiatrists’ attitudes toward lesbianism,
and hormonal determinants of sexual orientation.
Dr. Gartrell graduated Stanford in 1972 in the first class of Human Biology majors. She
attended medical school at U.C. Davis (1972-1976). In 1975, she organized the first
American Psychiatric Association (APA) presentation on lesbianism as an alternative form of
sexual expression. Dr. Gartrell completed her psychiatric residency at Harvard Medical
School’s Massachusetts Mental Health Center in 1979. During residency, Dr. Gartrell was
appointed an APA Falk Fellow to create a curriculum on the psychology of women and
men. She also completed a fellowship in Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry at Boston’s Beth
Israel Hospital in 1979.
Dr. Gartrell was an Instructor and then Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School
(1979-1987), and Director of Psychiatric Services at Beth Israel’s Healthcare Associates. She
became the first out lesbian physician on the medical school full-time faculty. Her teaching,
writing, and clinical work were devoted to promoting nonhomophobic healthcare for LGBT
people and eliminating sexism in medicine. Among her many endeavors at Harvard, she:
•

developed educational curricula and taught medical students, house officers, and
faculty how to provide nonhomophobic treatment to LGBT patients.

•

developed strategies to help closeted LGBT people come out to family, friends,
and co-workers.

•

served on the Joint Committee on the Status of Women

•

conducted research on such topics as psychiatric symptoms in medical students,
medical student stress, increased libido in women taking trazodone, and women’s
attitudes toward breast-conserving surgery

13

Within the American Psychiatric Association, Dr. Gartrell was appointed Assembly Deputy
Minority Representative for Women (1980-1982), and Vice-Chair and then Chair of the
Committee on Women (1980-1984).
In the 1980s and 1990s, Dr. Gartrell was the principal investigator of groundbreaking
investigations into sexual misconduct by physicians that led to new professional ethics codes
and the criminalization of boundary violations. For this work, Gartrell was featured in the
PBS Frontline documentary, “My Doctor, My Lover.”
Dr. Gartrell’s other scientific investigations have contributed to the ongoing struggle for
LGBT civil rights. These studies focus primarily on sexual minority parent families. Dr.
Gartrell is the principal investigator of the ongoing U.S. National Longitudinal Lesbian
Family Study that began in 1986 and still has a 92% retention rate as of 2019. Her
publications have been cited internationally in litigation and legislation concerning equality in
marriage, foster care, and adoption, and in numerous briefs filed with the US Supreme Court
for the hearings on Proposition 8 and marriage equality. Discover Magazine honored Dr.
Gartrell’s lesbian family research within its “100 Top Science Stories of 2010” edition.
From 1988-2011, Dr. Gartrell was Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at UCSF. Since
2009, she has been a Guest Appointee at the University of Amsterdam, and since 2010 a
Visiting Distinguished Scholar at the Williams Institute, UCLA School of Law.
Dr. Gartrell is married to psychiatrist and Academy Award nominated documentary
filmmaker Dee Mosbacher, MD, PhD. The two have been a couple since 1975, and they are
the joint recipients of a Mathew O. Tobriner Public Service Award from the Legal Aid
Society.

NANETTE GARTRELL

INTERVIEWER:

NATALIE MARINE-STREET

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

AUGUST 29, 2018

PART:

1 OF 5

Marine-Street: This is Natalie Marine-Street with the Stanford Historical Society Oral
History Program. Today is August 29, 2018, and I’m here with Dr. Nanette
Gartrell, noted psychiatrist and Stanford alumna. We’re conducting this
interview at Dr. Gartrell’s home in San Francisco as part of the Stanford
Pioneering Women Alumnae Oral History project. Doctor, I was hoping we
could start by just having you restate your name and tell us when and where
you were born.
Gartrell: [00:00:30] Nanette Gartrell. I was born June 28, 1949, in Santa Barbara,
California.
Marine-Street: You did a recent interview with the Stanford Pride Oral History project
where you covered a lot of things about your early life, but I had a couple of
questions that I wanted to ask as an addendum to that interview. The first
was could you tell me what Santa Barbara was like in terms of any kind of
lesbian or gay population and what was your awareness of this identity when
you were a child?
15

Gartrell: [00:01:08] I was unaware of any lesbian or gay population. I grew up in the
1950s and only heard passing references to people being “queer” or
“homos.” I had a very homophobic uncle who lived in San Francisco and
once when we came up to visit for one of the holidays, he piled us all in the
car and then he drove us around the Castro and Polk Street and pointed out
“the homos” and “the queers” in a very disparaging way. That was my
introduction to what I already knew that I was from the time that I was three
years old.
Marine-Street: About when was this that he drove you around the Castro? Do you have any
sense about how old you were?
Gartrell: [00:01:59] I was probably eight or nine years old.
Marine-Street: That’s interesting to me that you said since the age of three, you sort of had
an awareness. Could you tell me a little bit more about that or give me some
examples?
Gartrell: [00:02:10] It just became clear to me that my attractions were to females not
to males. I really had no interest in physical closeness to males. I didn’t have
an interest in having a boyfriend or even male friends. Later, as I got older, I
had crushes on females and, again, just no interest in males. My maturation in
that identity happened at the same time that I got older, but it was just a clear
identity that I had from the time that I was three. The interesting thing about
it was there was also no dysphoria other than the fact that I was aware that
people like my uncle and everyone who laughed at those kinds of jokes had
very negative feelings about what I was and what I was to become.
Marine-Street: Were there any lesbian couples in Santa Barbara that you were aware of?
16

Gartrell: [00:03:13] There was a possible lesbian couple, one of whom lived in our
neighborhood. Both women were married and my father and mother and
other neighbors made negative comments about these two women because
when they became friends, they both cut their hair short. They both got the
same kind of car, which I think was a Ford--some kind of small Ford
convertible--and they would race up and down the streets together. They
wore the same clothes, and they spent all their time together when their
children were in school. There were negative comments made about them
and suspicion about their being lesbian.
Marine-Street: Did you ever interact with them in any way?
Gartrell: [00:03:55] I babysat for the one who lived in the neighborhood, but I had no
information about what was going on in her personal life.
Marine-Street: You also mentioned in the other interview that you had kind of a traumatic
childhood. In your papers that are at Smith College, you have a biographical
statement that you wrote. In it you talk about some instances of sexual
violence that happened. I wonder if you’d be willing to just talk a little bit
about those.
Gartrell: [00:04:30] When I was six years old, we lived next door to a physician who
had three sons. One of them was a teenager. He and a friend of his lured me
and my brother over to their treehouse and said, “Wouldn’t you like to come
see our treehouse?” He said, “You go up first” to me and I started climbing,
and I said, “Come on, Greg” [to my brother]. And he [the neighbor] said,
“No, no, you wait down there.” They wouldn’t let him up. They got me up
there, and they had a .22 rifle and they pointed the rifle at me and demanded
17

that I engage in sexual activity with them, which I don’t think there’s a point
in describing, but it was phenomenally traumatic. I thought that they were
going to kill me, and they threatened to come get me if I told anyone.
What happened afterwards was I got down, and I burst into tears and
ran to my home. My mother and father were both home at the time. My
father examined me physically, which was further embarrassing, and then
went over and screamed at the neighbors and told them he was calling the
police. Then they consulted--I don’t know whom--who said that it would be
very traumatic for me to go to court to testify against these boys, and it was
better just to leave [it as it was, with] whatever threat my father made against
them. We lived in that house for another year and a half. I was terrified every
single day. I was terrified every single night. I was afraid they were going to
crawl into my window. I actually was terrified throughout the rest of my
childhood about the prospect of being raped or assaulted after that incident.
Marine-Street: Were there any ramifications for the assaulters?
Gartrell: [00:06:35] None whatsoever. When we moved to a new home far across
town from where they lived, there was an unfortunate response on my
mother’s part to a question I asked in a veiled way, hoping that it wouldn’t be
obvious why I was asking the question. I said to her, “Do you think there’s
any chance those neighbors know where we live now?” She said, “Oh, of
course, I’m sure they know,” which just took away any feeling of safety that I
could have had at this new home.
Marine-Street: Did you get any kind of counseling or help?
Gartrell: [00:07:13] No.
18

Marine-Street: What did they call what happened to you in those days?
Gartrell: [00:07:22] Teenage boys acting badly.
Marine-Street: Has your understanding of that changed over time?
Gartrell: [00:07:32] It was sexual violence at gunpoint and very, very, very traumatic.
Marine-Street: You also mentioned to me that you almost were kidnapped. Was that about
that same time?
Gartrell: [00:07:48] It was a few years later. We lived next to a lemon orchard. Our
house backed up against the lemon orchard. We were not a family of means.
We lived in a small track house in Santa Barbara. Our school bus dropped us
off about, I would say, a fifteen-minute walk from my home. I had seen a car
that followed the school bus frequently, and it was an old man driving an old
car. On most days when we were dropped off, there were many of us
children. On this particular day, I was the only one. I got off the bus, and I
was walking in a fairly leisurely way next to the lemon orchard to my home.
This car pulled up next to me, and he rolled down his window, and he said,
“You need to get in. You need to get in.” He looked very frightening to me,
and I started running, and he started following me. There was enough room
where he could follow me off the road.
I started screaming and running, and I ran through the lemon
orchard [so] he couldn’t take his car through the lemon orchard. I got into
my house the back way and went into my room and looked out the window,
and I saw that he was cruising by trying to find me. I told my parents. They
then called the police and they allegedly looked for this person, but I [often]
saw the car [parked] within a mile of our home and no one ever apprehended
19

the person. It was another instance in which, again, there was a complete lack
of feeling safe.
Marine-Street: What did you do as a child after those instances to kind of make yourself feel
safe?
Gartrell: [00:09:57] I didn’t feel safe. I felt frightened all the time. I felt frightened in
my home, outside of my home. I was always afraid of being raped. I was
always afraid of being assaulted.
Marine-Street: How can you function if you’re always afraid?
Gartrell: [00:10:12] There are a lot of things that contributed to fear in my life and my
parents unfortunately were not psychologically healthy. There was major
mental illness in my family so I had that factor contributing to my state of
not feeling safe. My father had severe panic disorder, and he was pretty much
afraid of the world and afraid of going anywhere. When you have a role
model of one parent who is afraid of the world and another parent who was
quite mentally ill in a different way, it’s not an environment in which a child
grows up being given an opportunity to feel safe. On top of that, I then had
teachers who hit on me before I left for college.
For instance, when I was a tenth grade student, I had a Latin teacher
who said to me he wanted to start driving me home. I thought that I needed
to comply with that, [but when I] told my father and mother, they said,
“Well, he can come here and meet us, but he’s not driving you home.” He
touched me in ways that were very creepy. Touched my body and his hands
were not where they should be. I mean, here I was doing well academically
and having somebody trying to paw me and trying to drive me home.
20

Marine-Street: I know you were a good student. You mentioned that in the last interview. I
wondered if you would talk a little bit about your studies in high school. You
set sort of a mission for yourself, I think you mentioned.
Gartrell: [00:12:12] I had a mission. My parents did not leave Santa Barbara. My father
was too afraid to leave based on his panic disorder. He wanted to go to
medical school, but he was too afraid to leave Santa Barbara because that was
too foreign to him. My mother was mentally ill. They wanted me to stay in
Santa Barbara and take care of them. They wanted me to go to UCSB. They
were happy to have me go to college, but they wanted me to stay in Santa
Barbara. And that was the last thing I wanted to do because I had already
been taking care of both of them since the time I was eleven years old when
my mother was psychiatrically hospitalized. I was the oldest child and the
parent in the family at that point, and from that point on. So I wanted to get
out of there.
We had no money. In fact, as soon as my mother was hospitalized,
we had very, very, very little money and no resources, no opportunity to
understand how one went about getting a scholarship. But I did have a sixth
grade teacher whose name was Dr. Will Hayes, who, in a way, took me under
his wing to offer a few meetings to talk about what I needed to do in order
to get into good colleges because he had done that for his own sons. He had
chosen me as a student to be in his class in sixth grade. What he said was
basically, “You have to get straight A’s. You have to have activities. You have
to get good letters of recommendation. In order to get good letters of

21

recommendation, you need to ask the teachers who think that you’re the
most impressive student they’ve had in a long time.”
I knew that my classmates--we were tracked into [three levels]-supposedly the smart students, the students who were average, and then the
students who were really tragically not unintelligent but very often immigrant
children whose first language was not English. [Sadly], they didn’t get the
same kind of education even in public schools that those whose first
language was English did. The message was basically you need to do very,
very well. My classmates in this upper track were predominantly the sons and
daughters of engineers--aerospace engineers--because Vandenberg Air Force
Base was nearby. There were a lot of engineers in firms that were developing
around Santa Barbara. There were [also] professors’ children from UCSB and
[others who] were physicians’ sons and daughters. Many of them were
already talking about going to Stanford. Stanford was the place to go. I had it
on my radar, and my goal was to do well enough to obtain an academic
scholarship because we couldn’t afford anything and barely the application. I
don’t remember whether there were application fees, but certainly no prep
courses. There weren’t that many those days in the way there are now, but
really no formal counseling.
[00:15:46] I mean, in fact, the counselor in my high school said, “Oh,
you shouldn’t apply to Stanford. Stanford just throws the applications up a
series of stairs, and whichever ones land on top, they get in.” And, “Don’t
waste your time. There’s no chance that you’ll get into Stanford.” And also,

22

“You’re not the son or daughter of an alum and those are the students also
who get in, so don’t bother to try.”
Marine-Street: Right. It had a real reputation as kind of a country club school, huh?
Gartrell: [00:16:20] It had the reputation of being a very academic, very privileged
university.
Marine-Street: I forgot to ask you, were your parents college-educated?
Gartrell: [00:16:45] My father went to UCSB. In fact, I went to his college graduation
when I was two years old. My mother, who was very, very, very intelligent as
a young child, was accidentally hit in the head by a baseball bat that her
brother was wielding when she was four or five years old. She’d already
taught herself to read as a three-year-old, and she went from that to having
double vision, severe dyslexia, long-term head trauma, [and] multiple
episodes of meningitis. She could barely read after that head trauma. She had
no treatment for it, and so she barely made it through high school.
Marine-Street: Did they have expectations for you, in terms of what they thought you
should do as a career?
Gartrell: [00:17:35] [laughter] I decided that I was going to go into medicine because
my sister was four years younger and a very talented writer. My siblings were
very, very academically successful. I never had confidence in my success. I
always felt that I worked hard, but I wasn’t really very smart. I knew my
brother was brilliant. Because he wanted to be an astronaut, he studied
physics when he was ten years old--just laying on his bed reading physics--so
that by the time that I took physics, he was actually helping me with physics,

23

and he had never taken a physics course. My sister was a really talented
writer. I had confidence in their abilities, but not in my own intellect.
My sister was getting a lot of attention saying she was going to be a
physician. One thing I knew I was very good at--because I had advanced to
algebra when I was ten years old on independent study in my public school-I knew I was very good at math. And I loved math. I would tell people that I
wanted to be a mathematician. People just glazed over when they heard that.
“Mathematician--oh, how boring. Yvonne, tell us about wanting to be a
physician.” [laughter] After a few years, I decided I was going to ditch the
mathematician part, even though I was studying math and loving math, and
just say I was going to be a physician. Then people were interested. “Oh,
that’s great now that you want to be a physician. Tell us about that.” Actually,
I got into becoming a pre-med student really not through an inherent interest
but because [Yvonne] was getting more attention than I was from her career
path.
Marine-Street: It’s interesting to me that you and your sister both chose as your kind of
dream jobs, whether it be mathematician or physician, something that was
not really typical for women at the time. Had you ever met a female physician
or mathematician?
Gartrell: [00:19:30] I met a female pediatrician when I was 17 years old when I asked
not to go back to the same old--to me--creepy white man, general
practitioner I’d been seeing as a child. Every time he would come to our
house to see us when we were sick, it was so completely embarrassing. There
I was an adolescent, and I got pneumonia, for instance, and he came to
24

examine me. He pulled down the sheets, pulled up my nightgown with my
father and mother standing right there and everybody standing around, with
my breasts exposed, and put his stethoscope--cold stethoscope--on my chest.
I did actually for a short period of time get to see a woman
pediatrician. She just was wonderful and so inspiring and so thoughtful about
how she did the exam and thoughtful about my privacy as she was doing it.
She did my first pelvic exam. I mean, I was kind of mortified, but she helped
me be less mortified.
Marine-Street: That’s really interesting because later, of course, that will be something that
you care a lot about--the way patients are treated. But you didn’t feel a kind
of pressure to conform to--? I’ve interviewed other people who grew up
during that time that tell me, “Well, my choice was I was going to be a
teacher or I was going to be a nurse or I was going to be a physical
therapist.” But do you just want to talk a little bit about gender expectations?
Gartrell: [00:21:10] Yes, there was a very vital part of that decision--which was I knew
I was a lesbian. I already knew I was a lesbian from the time I was three years
old, so how was I going to support myself? My family didn’t have any
money. I didn’t even know if I was going to be able to have the money I
needed for toothpaste when I went to college. So how was I going to support
myself? The role modeling in a heterosexually dominant culture was for
women to be dependent on men who earned money, who supported them
and the family. I didn’t have that so I needed to support myself. I needed a
career in which I could support myself.

25

Marine-Street: Just one more question about that earlier time and this is jumping forward a
little bit but, as you think back to those years and what I think was an awfully
traumatic childhood, how do you think it impacted what happened later in
your career? Have you thought about that or can you pinpoint it?
Gartrell: [00:22:17] I mean, certainly I went into psychiatry--a big motivation for going
into psychiatry was that I started doing research as an undergraduate at
Stanford in psychiatry and I just loved it. It really was part of my mission
around doing studies that looked at stereotypes and assumptions about
lesbian and gay people. However, there was a parallel track, which was [that]
I came from a family of mentally ill parents, how [can] I achieve some feeling
of control over that in relation to my own life? I didn’t like the prospect of
having the same experiences that they had, and I really didn’t want to go
there. So if I could understand something more about their illnesses, perhaps
it wouldn’t happen to me.
Marine-Street: One more question and then we’ll really get to Stanford. During this early
time, before you came to Stanford, did you ever tell anybody else that you
were a lesbian?
Gartrell: [00:23:42] Oh no. Oh no. No. Absolutely not. Didn’t act on it. Didn’t tell
anyone.
Marine-Street: You get to Stanford. Tell me what Stanford was like when you arrived in-was it 1967?
Gartrell: [00:23:57] Yes. First of all, I was given a full academic scholarship, and I was
thrilled. It was really my dream coming true. I thought the campus was
beautiful. I loved how it smelled--the sage and the--I don’t know if oak trees
26

smell but whatever the smells are that as we walk around Stanford campus,
we smell--sage and brush and trees and eucalyptus and so on. I just loved
everything about my entry to Stanford. I hadn’t had close friends ever before.
I didn’t have a best friend ever. I always wanted to. When I was small, I read
about girls having best friends. I never had that. Part of that I attributed to
the fact that my mother’s mental illness was known in our community, and I
felt that there was a stigma to having her illness be known. I do know that
there was a time when I invited a friend over, and there was this very long
conversation at the other end of the phone where she was talking to her
mother about coming over to our home. I’m certain it was all about whether
or not it was safe for her to allow her child to come into our home.
I really wanted to have friends. I chose to be in an all-women’s dorm-Roble. Actually, I think it was the last year that there were all-women dorms.
I wanted to be with all first-year students, all women, and there were 400 of
us arriving at Roble. That was really exciting to me. Within the structure of
Roble, we had corridors, and we were on the furthest away corridor from the
front door on the third floor. I was lucky enough to get a single corner room
so that was thrilling for me. There were twenty-three of us or twenty-four of
us on this corridor, and so I was just very eager to make friends because that
[corridor] became our first identity. In fact, I made friends very rapidly [with
women] who are close to me to this day. That was absolutely thrilling to me
to have the opportunity to make friends and to be part of a community. The
community was our corridor.
Marine-Street: How well prepared were you academically did you find?
27

Gartrell: [00:26:54] I was actually over prepared it turned out. I mean, we didn’t have
any money for any kind of preparation for testing or anything like that. I was
a very anxious test-taker in high school, and so I was petrified of taking the
SATs. When I got to Stanford, I found out that kids who went to prep
schools had practiced for the SATs. I thought, “Oh wow. Wouldn’t that have
been nice?” [laughter]
Marine-Street: What a concept.
Gartrell: [00:27:25] Yes, what a concept. Because I’d studied really thoroughly and I
knew that my only chance of doing well on the SATs was to try and
remember everything I could remember from chemistry and physics and
whatever. As a pre-med student, I had to repeat those same classes. It was
complete repetition of what I already knew so it was very easy to do well,
despite my father’s parting advice when they dropped me off. He said, “You
know you got straight A’s in high school but you won’t get straight A’s at
Stanford because it’s much harder. It’ll be much harder so just prepare
yourself. You’re not going to get perfect grades.” That was pretty much of a
downer, you know. It’s like, “Don’t aspire. Settle for less. You’re not good
enough to do that.”
Marine-Street: Did you have any memorable courses that you took?
Gartrell: [00:28:26] Let’s see. Memorable really related to Human Biology, but that’s
jumping ahead into my senior year. I did not declare a major until I was a
senior because I couldn’t find a major I really enjoyed after the first
preliminary class until Human Biology was created. I just thought it was
fabulous to have an interdisciplinary major. It is no surprise to me that it’s
28

[laughter] become the most popular major at Stanford and it’s been copied all
over the country and is an incredibly popular major.
Marine-Street: Did you have a class with Phil Zimbardo?
Gartrell: [00:29:08] I took the first class he ever taught at Stanford, Psych 101, and he
was quite a showman then as he is today. I will say also that right after the
most recent election--2016 election--Dee [Dee Mosbacher] and I and another
colleague spoke out about the mental instability of the person who is now
occupying the White House. That went viral and, subsequently, a book came
out of that to which Dee and I contributed the final chapter before Noam
Chomsky’s end-of-the-species epilogue. Phil Zimbardo and a co-author
[Rosemary Sword] contributed a chapter as well. It’s called The Dangerous Case
of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Others Assess a President. It’s interesting to
me to have had him as a faculty member, and both of us now at this stage of
our lives contributing to [the same] book.
Marine-Street: Can you give me a little bit of an idea of what the kind of political and social
environment is at Stanford? I’m thinking you’re arriving there in 1967. It’s
during the Vietnam War. I know there was some activism on campus. I just
would like to hear a little bit about those aspects of Stanford.
Gartrell: [00:31:13] Well, I came out. On my corridor there was an RA who became
my first lover. So I basically came out in 1967 in that relationship with her.
She was a rabble rouser and really wanted to shake all of us up in terms of
our political thinking. Shortly after we arrived, we were all sitting around
having what were called “spreads” where dessert and things were brought in
to just hang out, probably on a weekend night. She said, “How many of you
29

are Republicans?” Every hand went up or almost every hand went up.
[laughter] She just went, “Oh, how terrible. Oh my God, I can’t believe it.”
Then within weeks when that question was asked again, the hands were sort
of at half-mast, and then soon after that they just never raised again. She
exposed us, happily, to a lot of the political activism that had been
developing.
Her brother had been close to David Harris and so we all learned
who David Harris was and Joan Baez. And then the antiwar movement
became a really big force in our lives. So much so that there was a big
movement across campus to have classes all pass/fail rather than graded so
that we could spend our time both doing movement activities as well as
studying, which was a little bit problematic later in applying to medical school
because I had to justify a “pass” in organic chemistry. Of course, I hated
organic chemistry [laughter] as everyone does, but, the long-term usefulness
of that kind of strategy was not really something that was probably carefully
thought out.
In any case, the antiwar movement happened. And I was involved
not as a leader, [but] as a participant. What I saw was the evolving
effectiveness of this mass movement that was happening not only at
Stanford but all over the country in terms of changing the thinking about
what we were doing in Vietnam. That was a powerful lesson to me. What I
did not like about the movement is that it was totally male-dominated and it
was a continuation of the so-called “free love movement”--which meant free
sex for men, [the] consequences for women be damned. The expectation was
30

that women were there to service men, and men should be entitled to have
sex whenever they wanted or demanded it. That was a pretty appalling aspect
of that movement.
Marine-Street: I want to ask you if you could maybe give me an example of something that
you observed that made you see that kind of dynamic?
Gartrell: [00:34:46] First of all, I have heard from you that there were some women
who were actively involved in a leadership position. I didn’t ever see them.
We basically had men telling us what to do and how to do it and men who
were urging violence and smashing windows and things like that, which did
not, to me, seem like a useful strategy. The only time that I actually
advocated something in a large group that happened was [when] there was a
huge number of us outside the corner of the Quad closest to Hoover Tower-is it still called HooTow and things like that or is that language not there
anymore?
Marine-Street: I haven’t heard HooTow.
Gartrell: [00:35:49] MemChu, none of those?
Marine-Street: MemChu is still there but Hoover--they just call it Hoover Tower or Hoover.
Gartrell: It was MemAud, MemChu, HooTow, things like that. Okay. Anyway, the
men were saying, “Let’s go smash all the windows, let’s go do this--.”And
I’m thinking, why is this effort destroying Stanford’s campus? Why don’t we
march into Palo Alto where outside people will pay attention? What is
destroying the building doing for us? So I just yelled out, “Let’s march to
Palo Alto.” The police were on the outside of the campus anticipating such a
thing. I didn’t know that. The word just kind of went through the crowd and
31

then we, in fact, did march to Palo Alto and then the police [started charging
the demonstrators]. Then everybody started running and some were arrested
and some weren’t and so on.
That became a new trend in how people seemed to be demonstrating
and marching. It wasn’t just violence against Stanford’s physical property but
taking the movement into communities [where] many other strategies were
used. [The former strategy] was another example of the male wish to use
violence as a resistance to violence and death in Vietnam, which did not have
logic for me.
Marine-Street: Interesting. What about the free love movement you mentioned? Can you tell
me how that manifested itself in the environment as you experienced it?
Gartrell: [00:37:33] I’ll say something about encounter groups. The summer before we
entered Stanford, to my knowledge, every one of us received a letter offering
the opportunity to participate in an encounter group when we arrived. It was
described as an opportunity to have a member of the Counseling and Testing
Center meet with a small group of us to talk about our experiences and to get
to know one another well and share things that we might not feel
comfortable sharing just in general. But, you know, in a safe environment. I
read it. My parents read it. At first I thought, “Why not, it sounds good.” My
parents read it and thought, “Oh, wow, free therapy. Great. So do it.” I
signed up to do it and we met.
In my group, for some strange reason, my RA who happened to
become my lover was in my group but there were no other women. There
were about five other men and then we had a male who was a member of the
32

Counseling and Testing Center staff running the group. We met in
Escondido--in one of the Escondido apartments--I don’t know if they’re still
called Escondido Apartments. Are they still called that? The tall buildings
that are across from the firehouse.
Marine-Street: I think they are--Escondido, yes. They’re doing a lot of reconstruction up
there right now.
Gartrell: [00:39:00] I know. Everything’s changing. There were apartments that senior
students could live in. So two women who were seniors lived there, and they
allowed us to use their apartment. It was clear from the very beginning that
the conversations were going in the direction of sex and talking about sexual
feelings and that was something that seemed to be thrilling to the men to be
able to do and felt creepy to me. Early into these meetings, we were told to
pair off and there were all those kinds of touchy-feely things that were done
back then in group dynamics where you close your eyes and, you know, see
what you can communicate to another person through holding their hands
like this and things like that. That kind of pairing off, we were given some
instructions about that.
I found out later that the woman who became my lover, my RA, and
the man she was paired off with--what he did was he reached around, undid
her bra, and was feeling her breasts during that encounter. That made me feel
incredibly freaked out. She didn’t complain. She just went along with it. She
was sexually involved with men before she became involved with me. I
guess, I don’t know, some number of sessions later, we arrived and the group
leader was on the couch holding the hands and stroking one of the women
33

who lived in the apartment. He said, “Well, let’s resume later.” She went into
the bedroom, and we started our meeting and he stopped it after, I don’t
know, five or ten minutes. And he said, “You know, I have some unfinished
business to do with what’s-her-name and so why don’t you carry on without
me.” We kind of, I don’t know, carried on somehow without him. I had to
go to the bathroom, and I got up to go to the bathroom, and the door to the
room was open and they were having sex.
And I, from other women classmates, heard similar stories of power
and sex abuse by these people who supposedly represented mental health
professionals affiliated with Stanford, which was just appalling.
Marine-Street: Was he a student?
Gartrell: [00:41:43] No, he was a member of the Counseling and Testing Center staff
in the Dean of Students Office at the Old Union.
Marine-Street: The girl that he was having sex with was an older student?
Gartrell: [00:41:55] Student, yes. She was a senior.
Marine-Street: But an undergraduate?
Gartrell: [00:41:57] Yes.
Marine-Street: Well that’s an encounter group I guess.
Gartrell: [00:42:01] Yes, that’s an encounter of a sort.
Marine-Street: Yes, of a sort. Anything else on that topic? You wrote somewhere that it was
“an environment of daily sexual harassment” during that time.
Gartrell: [00:42:14] Yes. It was. Another illustration of the kind of commentary that
was just routine and so irritating when it happened was initially when I got
there, I guess miniskirts weren’t in fashion yet, but they kind of became in
34

fashion. I wore skirts and shorts. I wore a lot of shorts while it was hot and
then I wore skirts some of the time. Actually, they were culotte skirts so that
they were kind of like shorts. And my skirts got somewhat shorter as time
went on because that was the fashion. I happened to generally make my own
clothes because we didn’t have the money to buy them. As I came out and
became involved in--or had much more awareness of--feminism and got
really excited about the beginning of the second wave of feminism, I started
changing my clothing style and wearing clothes that were comfortable, not
clothes that attracted attention from men. Because my short skirts--well, I
mean, I figured all women attracted attention from men--but I felt that the
way I dressed attracted attention and it was unwanted attention. I started
wearing comfortable clothes that felt so good and so safe. That included
overalls and turtlenecks when it was cold. One of my classmates said to me,
after I had started wearing these clothes, turned over to me before our class
started and said, “You know I liked you a lot better when you were wearing
miniskirts. You really look terrible in overalls.”
Marine-Street: This is a male classmate?
Gartrell: [00:44:26] A male classmate.
Marine-Street: How did you respond? Do you remember?
Gartrell: [00:44:29] I just looked kind of horrified and I felt just invaded, and I felt it
was an indication of this kind of entitlement to dictate the clothing of a
classmate and very aware of the difference in my feeling of safety wearing
overalls and a turtleneck versus a short skirt.

35

Marine-Street: Interesting. We’ll go for just a little longer and then we’ll take a break. Did
you ever talk to any of your female friends about these issues about dress or
the encounter groups? Did others feel your discomfort?
Gartrell: [00:45:26] Others talked about their encounter group leaders then, but my
very close friends and I have talked about the abuse of power since then. It
was something that none of them felt good about. Back then, my friends
were dating males and I was involved with a woman. The friendships were
very, very important to me and I didn’t want to do anything that criticized
men as a group and potentially jeopardize the friendships. I didn’t really have
a peer group with whom I could have these conversations since they were
part of--they were dating the patriarchal structure and I was not.
Marine-Street: Your friends that were dating men, do you know did they have access to
birth control through the health service or anything?
Gartrell: [00:46:35] They must have but they were quite private about those details.
Most of my close friends were virgins when we arrived at Stanford. So we
talked a lot about virginity and then when people started going on dates and
the envelope was being pushed, when they would come back, we would say,
“So what did you do, what’d you do?” Then people starting being more
circumspect about what they would share. The sharing kind of stopped once
they actually became sexually involved with their partners. I just had a lot of
questions about how they managed it.
Marine-Street: You mentioned that there was a story about an experience you had at the
Health Services that you wanted to share. I wonder if you could talk about
that?
36

Gartrell: [00:47:39] I was a first-year student and went for a gynecologic exam and the
gynecologist asked me about contraception. I said that I was involved with a
woman, and I didn’t need to have contraception, and I was a lesbian. She
said, “Oh that--that’s ridiculous. That just can’t be. That’s going to be
something that’s in passing. Occasionally people say things like that, but I’m
not going to take that seriously.” Which was very insulting.
Marine-Street: So she didn’t advise you to get counseling or anything? She just sort of
laughed it off?
Gartrell: [00:48:30] Just laughed it off as a non-reality, just basically denied my
existence.
Marine-Street: But she had offered you contraception?
Gartrell: [00:48:43] She [was] happy to offer me contraception and hoped that I use it.
Marine-Street: One more question related to this. Did you have any knowledge of sexual
assaults that were occurring on campus? Was that something that happened
then?
Gartrell: [00:49:00] Yes, we were told periodically about rapes that happened and
women being assaulted outside our dorm. This was starting our first year at
Stanford. The lighting was very poor. Our bikes were parked in really dim
lighting. I already came to Stanford as a frightened person--worrying about
assault and violence. This was not helpful to me at all. We did, as our peer
group of women, talk about our fears of going to the library at night. I was
petrified of going to the library at night because it involved going out to get
my bike where it was dimly lit, where anyone could be grabbed, riding my bike
through dark streets to the library, and at both of those places locking the
37

bike. All of these things, if there’s nobody else around, made me quite
vulnerable and then being in the library, studying until whatever hour, and
then making my way back. I was petrified.
I mean, from the moment I left the dorm I was petrified. The whole
process of thinking about going to the library made me petrified, which
meant that I didn’t go as often as I wanted to or needed to, which meant that
I felt that my [education suffered]. Well, I mean, it was my choice about
safety or my fears about safety that prevented me from making adequate uses
of the library. At that time, there were no [alarm boxes]. I know now that it
seems like every twenty feet, there’s an alarm box and I also know that there
is [00:50:53] a lot of attention to safety. I’m not talking about the kind of
safety that involves drinking alcohol and saying no. I’m talking about just
trying to go to the library or trying to go to a night class. I mean, there were
things that were happening at night that unless I was going as a member of a
group, it didn’t feel safe attending.
Marine-Street: Did you and any of the other women students do anything to try to feel
more safe?
Gartrell: [00:51:25] No, we just didn’t feel safe and--I mean, it didn’t occur to us that
we had an opportunity to do anything.
Marine-Street: Was there any kind of like self-defense courses or anything?
Gartrell: [00:51:37] I don’t remember what year it was, but I think it was probably my
senior year that a self-defense course was offered, not as an elective but just
as a campus activity, and I took it. I found out about it however--going to
school at a time when there was no internet, any information you received
38

was word-of-mouth, you happened to have the time to read a flyer in White
Plaza, or you happened to have time to read the Stanford Daily, or you had
access to the Daily regularly, which I didn’t always, especially if I was living
off-campus. It was really a matter of luck if you found out about something
that you really wanted to do and needed to do. But somehow I found out
about it. I attended this class and I loved it.
I loved the concept of being taught that I was entitled to pay
attention to my fears and that whenever I did feel afraid--whenever
something happened that made me feel more afraid--I should pay attention
to my feelings because they were a good indicator of my potential risk. My
lover who had sex with men before she met me, [and] had sex with men
throughout the time she was with me--she was not comfortable being
lesbian, didn’t want to identify as lesbian, wanted to get married, [and] spent
the whole time that I was at Stanford looking for a man to marry at the same
time she was involved with me--always said, “Oh, you’re just a wimp, you
know, stop being so afraid. What are you so afraid of? You’re so afraid of sex
with men? Why are you so uptight? You’re just incredibly uptight?” Always
the message, “You are really, really uptight.”
To have this validation in this self-defense class that paying attention
to [my feeling of fear]--granted, I came from a background of more fear that
I carried within me than I wish I ever did--but that if something kicked it up
to a higher level, that my feelings were valid and I needed to pay attention to
them and I needed to do something about them immediately. Then to learn
self-defense techniques to fight or to fight back or to release myself was
39

fabulous. It was such an incredible opportunity to have--to create a sense of
empowerment.
Marine-Street: Was it a male instructor, do you remember?
Gartrell: [00:54:27] Absolutely not. It was all women.
Marine-Street: All women?
Gartrell: [00:54:29] Yes, I wouldn’t have taken a course from a man because how
could a man possibly have come from our experience and seen the world in
the way we saw the world?
Marine-Street: It was another student that was doing it? Do you recall?
Gartrell: [00:54:45] Yes, I believe it was another student or somebody from offcampus who came.
Marine-Street: Do you remember where they taught the classes?
Gartrell: [00:54:52] They were taught in the Roble Gym.
Marine-Street: Does anything stick with you about what they taught you like specific
techniques?
Gartrell: [00:55:03] They were techniques about releasing yourself if someone grabs
you and there were techniques about the most vulnerable [ways] to fight back
if you were assaulted. I go from that, fast forward to many years later when I
got to know Pauline Bart who was a very eloquent writer about rape and
women fighting back. She did studies about women who were trained to or
learned to fight back versus women who were trained to lie down and take it.
I had heard always growing up that if you’re assaulted; you’re going to be
killed if you fight back--until I took this class.

40

When I got to Pauline Bart’s readings and then got to know her as a
colleague and heard that there were actual data that the women who fought
back, very often, got away and were not raped versus those who submitted
were a hundred percent raped. There was no guarantee they weren’t going to
be killed. It was an incredibly eye-opening experience.
Marine-Street: I’ll say. Let’s take a quick break.
Gartrell: [00:56:29] Okay.

PART:

2 OF 5

Marine-Street: Before we move on, is there anything else you’d like to say about the selfdefense course?
Gartrell: [00:00:06] One other thing that just came to mind is in Pauline Bart’s
research about lying down and taking it versus fighting back--and fighting
back included using strategies to extract yourself. There were accounts that
she provided of women who actually talked men who had weapons out of
their weapons and then managed to escape without being assaulted. It’s really
quite phenomenal but not only did she find that if you do fight back or use a
strategy to escape that you have a chance of not being sexually violated. But
even if you were raped and you fought back, that the psychological sequelae
for those who resisted versus those who didn’t was dramatically different.
That is fascinating. That was always fascinating to me.
The fighters ultimately did better than those who thought that they
had to comply and didn’t try any strategies. Not that they’re to be blamed-those who are to be blamed are the police and the men who told us, “Don’t
43

resist, don’t resist.” They are to be blamed, and I have strong feelings about
that.
Marine-Street: Let’s switch to a different topic. Were you an athlete at Stanford?
Gartrell: [00:01:37] [laughter] I was. I joined the Stanford varsity swim team when I
arrived. I started on the team before Title IX, which came after I graduated,
which meant that Stanford women’s athletics had no special funding. Pam
Strathairn [Pamela Strathairn] was the director of Stanford women’s athletics.
We had our own gym without all the fancy accoutrement that the men had. It
was the Roble Gym. We also had the Roble pool. We swam in the Roble
pool. That’s where we practiced. It didn’t have--hmm, I don’t know-sufficient lighting for our late afternoon swim meets. It was freezing out
there, but I loved it.
I was a proud member of the varsity swim team. I swam freestyle,
and one of the things that makes me happiest about it, in retrospect, is that
every five years for my reunion, I’m invited to swim with the current varsity
team, [which means that in 2016], I had the opportunity to swim with the
Olympians who had just come back from winning all the gold medals at the
Olympics, including sharing water with the likes of Katie Ledecky, Simone
Manuel, Lia Neal. It was a phenomenally wonderful experience. I wore a
snorkel and mask. I started in the pool. I don’t dive anymore. Out of the
eight of us in my heat or my race, I came in, not surprisingly, eighth.
[laughter] But I was very, very happy.
Marine-Street: So you couldn’t keep up with Katie, huh?

44

Gartrell: [00:03:36] [laughter] I couldn’t keep up with one of them. I was the oldest
alum who was participating in the varsity versus alum swim meet by, I think,
three decades.
Marine-Street: That’s really awesome. I wanted to ask you about what the status of gay life
was at Stanford at the time? Were there any kind of organizations?
Gartrell: [00:04:18] Non-existent for me. Again, everything is word of mouth or what
you happen to read, but I knew of no other lesbian until I was a junior. I met
one other lesbian. I knew of no gay men. When the Gay Student Union
started, which I don’t even know how many people there were, I only heard
about it after the initial meeting. What made me aware of the possibility of
other lesbians on campus was when Maud Haimson, who was in [my] class,
wrote a letter to the Stanford Daily about being a lesbian in early 1971, [I
believe, and also] where she identified herself. I was thrilled to hear about
that.
Following that, I and a couple of people I knew organized the first
meeting of Stanford lesbians at our off-campus apartment. I don’t even
remember how we got the word out, but, in my life experience of doing
research back in those days, when we needed people [laughter] as volunteers,
we would put up fliers. So I’m guessing we probably put up fliers and [used]
word of mouth [among] the few people I knew. And people showed up I’d
never met before, including one woman I took a class with [whom] I saw
occasionally in class. I had no idea she was a lesbian.
Marine-Street: Did you know Maud before?
Gartrell: [00:06:09] No, I did not.
45

Marine-Street: After you read her letter, did you sort of seek her out then?
Gartrell: [00:06:16] I don’t remember how I ended up meeting her, but ultimately this
group included her. The Gay Student Union, although it’s in retrospect
described as women and men, maybe that’s the case because perhaps Maud
was there. My experience of joining gay/lesbian groups at the very beginning,
it was always me and men. Since I was interested in meeting with other
lesbians, I wouldn’t have sought out that group unless I had a really good
idea that there were lesbians present. And I didn’t have any expectation that
there would necessarily have been.
Marine-Street: Do you recall about how many people showed up to that first meeting?
Gartrell: [00:07:14] I think that there were about eight or so--eight or nine.
Marine-Street: If was off-campus? Where was your apartment?
Gartrell: [00:07:20] It was on--is there a Forest Street in Palo Alto? It was parallel to
University [Avenue] and it was past the town about four or five blocks--well
I don’t know how far the town has spread at this point but past what was
downtown Palo Alto four or five blocks and over a few blocks from
University in an apartment building.
Marine-Street: Do you recall what you all talked about at that first meeting?
Gartrell: [00:07:52] I don’t. [laughter] I don’t. I mean, the typical thing in all
subsequent meetings of that type was for people to go around and tell their
stories. I would not be at all surprised if we didn’t go around and tell our
stories. Two of the women who showed up were lovers and first-year
students. One of them had a set of parents who were potentially going to be

46

ballistic if they found out--and ultimately were. I don’t know if that came up
during that meeting, but that was something I found out about later.
Marine-Street: Just remind me again. Is this 1971?
Gartrell: [00:08:42] Yes.
Marine-Street: Okay, 1971. Did you have more meetings?
Gartrell: [00:08:48] We had more meetings and we also, at some point, invited Del
Martin [Dorothy Louise Taliaferro Martin] and Phyllis Lyon, who started the
first lesbian organization in the United States, Daughters of Bilitis, which was
started in the 1950s. It was started as a social alternative to the bar culture,
which was really the only, as I understand it, culture that existed for lesbians
prior to that. They were leaders--both nationally and in San Francisco--of this
lesbian movement. So we invited them down, got to know them, and I’ve
known them--I knew them--ever since, up through Del’s illness and death,
and still know Phyllis.
Marine-Street: Did they come to your apartment?
Gartrell: [00:09:44] Yes.
Marine-Street: The meeting was at your apartment?
Gartrell: [00:09:47] Yes.
Marine-Street: Did the group grow in size, or did it stay about those eight people?
Gartrell: [00:09:51] It never formalized as a group. We had those meetings, and I can’t
even say how many of them. I mean, I have a vague recollection there might
have been four or five before the end of the quarter. I didn’t reinitiate them
the following year. I became an RA. Then I had a network of more lesbians
that I knew, but I don’t recall having anybody else take responsibility for
47

continuing the organization of those meetings. I was very involved already in
my research so that became my priority focus.
Marine-Street: Do you have any memory of what Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon--what kind
of advice they gave to you all, or what the subject of the meeting was?
Gartrell: [00:10:53] I think they were thrilled that this was happening at Stanford. They
were thrilled that we were a bunch of young academically-oriented women
who were thinking about various careers. I know that they talked about being
out. I think they probably saw themselves as potential mentors for us. In
knowing them over time, I remember a decade or so after that bemoaning to
them that we hadn’t come very far in our efforts despite all the progress that
had been made. And they just said, “You know, you just haven’t been alive
long enough. If you’ve been alive as long as we have, you would see just this
enormous progress. You just wait until you’ve been alive as long as we have
and been out as long as we have and have been working on this as long as we
have, and you’ll sing a different tune.” They were, in fact, right.
Marine-Street: Before we talk about your research, I just wanted to ask you did you go
abroad during your time at Stanford?
Gartrell: [00:12:09] I did. I went to Austria in 1969. Why Austria? Well I had a crush
on Julie Andrews [laughter] when I was in high school because I saw the
Sound of Music. I mean, I didn’t have real relationships. I had crushes on
movie stars. The first one was on Kim Novak when I was about thirteen.
The second one was on Julie Andrews when I saw the Sound of Music, and I
thought “Oh, Austria. Oh, I’ll study German and go to Austria, and maybe
I’ll find my Julie Andrews in Austria.” I studied German. Also my family had
48

no money and I’d never been out of California. We’d driven up here [San
Francisco] and back home because I had relatives here and stayed with the
relatives, but I’d never been out of California.
The opportunity to go abroad and being given enough money to
actually go to see Europe was something that was just incredibly inspiring to
me. I chose Austria and Julie Andrews and didn’t find Julie Andrews but had
another fabulous opportunity to have a community of friends, a new
community of friends, who were both men and women. I made some really
great friends who are lifelong friends who are men through that Austria
group. There were eighty of us living in Vienna. We were there at a really
momentous time. The Stonewall Riots happened in 1969, which was the first
time that LGBT people fought back against the police when they came in to
arrest them for being at a bar in New York, the Stonewall bar, and also we
landed on the moon, and the antiwar movement was continuing actively back
home.
I came back to this whole concept of lesbian and gay people not
taking it anymore. That’s a great concept. I had already decided because I was
pre-med and [had] the experience in Cowell [Stanford] Student Health
Services of a very bad interview by the physician I saw as a first-year student
that I was going to become a lesbian physician who would provide nonhomophobic care for lesbians and gay men. Non-homophobic care meant
not judging and making assumptions and telling people what they were or
weren’t and what their identity was or was not in the course of the interview,
but really asking and being open to learning and helping them with whatever
49

path they were on. I also decided because I was in academia, there were a lot
of paths open to me to do something about the fact that when I was at
Stanford, being lesbian was tantamount to being considered somebody who
was committing a sin. It was criminal, and it was considered a mental illness.
So I had an option [to consider]--what [was] I going to do about that?
Homosexuality was a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, and it seemed to me that I could use my resources to do research
that addressed stereotypes and assumptions about lesbian and gay people and
find out why homosexuality was in the DSM. Was it there just because there
were stereotypes and assumptions being made--which seemed highly likely?
Was it there because there was so much stigma that the sequelae of stigma-the sequelae of involuntarily psychiatrically hospitalizing LGBT people
because they were LGBT and then treating them, shocking them, giving
them hormones, giving them medications, [and] giving them terrible
homophobic treatment--[created] these traumatized individuals? And then
you examine these traumatized individuals, and you say, “Well, they’re really
disturbed.” Well, duh! [laughter] I really wanted to get involved in doing
research in some way. So that became my mission even before Human
Biology was created.
Marine-Street: That’s so striking to me because, you know, for someone as an
undergraduate to basically decide I’m going to create this new thing, this new
way of being a physician that challenges centuries of stereotypes and
prejudice. Did you have any kind of model or evidence that this might work?

50

Gartrell: [00:17:45] No, I had determination and I had anger. Anger about the
discrimination fueled my mission.
Marine-Street: Were there psychologists at the time or psychiatrists that were studying
homosexuality academically that you were aware of or had read?
Gartrell: [00:18:09] I’d certainly read Freud [Sigmund Freud] because I knew that I
would be needing to study Freud. I read a number of the old ancient analysts
and what they said. But no. No, I mean, there were not individuals who were
actually studying it from the perspective of let’s do a non-biased investigation
of non-institutionalized lesbian and gay men and see how they are. Those
who were studying lesbian and gay people were studying institutionalized
people. That’s not a representative sample of anything.
Marine-Street: Right. I wanted to ask you about something because I have a memory from
my childhood about when I had asked somebody about gay people and why
wasn’t it okay to be gay. The answer that I got was a very strange Cold War
answer. It was, “Well, they would be liable to be bribed. They can’t work for
the government because they could be bribed if somebody found out that
they were homosexuals and that’s bad for national security.” I remember
thinking, “Oh, well I hadn’t thought of that.” Was there any kind of Cold
War context that was influencing things or that you were aware of?
Gartrell: [00:19:40] I mean, later, yes, because we all learned about J. Edgar Hoover
who was gay himself, who ran that witch hunt and his lover. Yes, so in
retrospect, yes, and that continued for a very long time. I mean, all the way
up to the time that I was on the faculty at Harvard and I was seeing very,
very, very closeted people who worked in the government and were closeted
51

because they were afraid that they would lose their security clearances. I had
people fly up from Washington to see me under assumed names.
Marine-Street: That worked in the government that were worried about-Gartrell: [00:20:23] That were high up in the government and were worried about
losing their security clearances.
Marine-Street: Let’s talk about the research. How do you get this off the ground then?
Gartrell: [00:20:34] Human Biology started. I was an enthusiastic [member of the] first
graduating class of Human Biology. I finally declared a major, and I needed
to stay an extra year because you couldn’t complete Human Biology in one
year, which was fine with me because I was given money to do that.
[laughter] We needed to do a special project with a faculty member from
Human Biology. I had been spending some time trying to think about it
when Jane Goodall gave her lectures. You had asked me earlier whether I
had any female faculty and I couldn’t think of anybody until I realized Jane
Goodall gave some lectures in Human Biology.
I’d had one woman teaching assistant and a German teacher in
Austria, and I cannot think of a single other female faculty member during
my entire time at Stanford. This did not change. I mean, those kinds of
numbers did not change when I went to medical school nor when I did my
residency at Harvard. I mean, it was phenomenal back then. When Jane
Goodall came and started talking about her chimps and going to Africa, she
had people trailing her out of the building, of course, wanting to do a special
project with her. At a certain point, Keith Brodie, who was a young assistant
professor who had just come from NIH, came to lecture us on brain
52

biochemistry. I was fascinated by it. I just thought it was amazing and
interesting. So dynamic. And he was such a wonderful lecturer.
I had the great opportunity to listen to his lectures and then I
thought, “Could I possibly--?” I’m inherently shy. I [put on] a very good act
of being an extrovert. But I spent a lot of time contemplating whether I
could possibly be brave enough to make an appointment to go see him, to
ask him if I could do a special project with him. I worked that over quite a
bit before I made the appointment and went into his office and asked. He
was just so nice and so enthusiastic. “Oh, I’d be happy to have you as a
student.” He said, “I’ve had a couple of others and you [get to] decide what
you want to study. You could study anything. You should do some research.
I mean, you’re going to medical school. You should do some research. So
you can study anything you want. You can study homosexuality. You could
study--.” Then he listed all these other things, and I thought,
“Homosexuality? I hadn’t really walked in and said ‘I’m a lesbian.’ How did
he know?” [00:23:26]
He said, “Go think about it and come back and tell me in a week.” I
went back in a week, and I said, “Well, I’d really like to study something
related to homosexuality.”
He said, “Oh, that’s great. Are you gay?”
I said, “I am.” Then “gay” was a term for both women and men and
subsequently terms have changed, as you know. I identified as lesbian. He
said, “That’s fantastic because then you’re going to have an inside knowledge

53

of anything that you would decide to study so that’s fantastic. So what would
you like to work on?”
I said, “Well, homosexuality is a pathological diagnosis, and I would
like to do research that can help clarify whether there’s any validity to having
it in the DSM.”
He said, “That’s just fantastic. You know, of course, I think it’s
ridiculous that it’s there. I don’t know why it’s there. I don’t think we have
any data to support it being there so let’s figure out what you want to study.”
Gartrell: [00:24:40] The first project I did I said I, “Keith, you said that--.” It was Dr.
Brodie, then. I knew him forever--so [later] it was “Keith.” But, “You
thought that maybe the consensus about whether [there should be] a
diagnosis has changed and maybe there would be usefulness in documenting
that change.”
He said, “And how would you do that?”
I said, “I don’t know, maybe survey psychiatrists.” My first study was
to survey psychiatrists about their attitudes toward what we called female
homosexuality back then. We surveyed the Northern California Psychiatric
Association and found that a number of psychiatrists really thought that
there was no validity to having homosexuality in the DSM.
I was very excited about that. That became my first publication. At
the same time that we were working on that, Masters and Johnson’s group
had just put out a study--the lead author of that was a person named
Kolodny [Robert C. Kolodny]--in which they reported that gay men had
lower testosterone levels than straight men. They hypothesized that that’s
54

why gay men were gay--that they were effeminate because they didn’t have
enough testosterone.
Keith said, “You know, we should repeat that study. So can you
gather some gay men and straight men here at Stanford and let’s do a study.”
I knew a guy--his name was Tom Rhue, who was in the administration--who
was gay. I went to him and said, “Can you find twenty volunteers who would
be willing to give their blood and participate in this study?”
I asked other friends. I looked for twenty straight men. And these
were not people I knew, but I just used my resources and I gathered together
twenty of each. We drew their bloods and got their consents and so on and
found out that gay men at Stanford had higher testosterone levels than the
straight men. [laughter] Not only did it demonstrate that this theory--this
[simplistic] hormonal theory of the origins of homosexuality--was unlikely to
have tremendous validity, but it also was an early contribution to the research
that was looking at biologic origins to sexuality.
Marine-Street: How did you get like all the blood drawn and everything?
Gartrell: [00:27:48] Keith had funding. He was a Stanford faculty member, and he
could devote funding to various resources, and he was a researcher. He came
from NIH, so he was expected to be a researcher. He could just devote some
of the funding that he had to this project. I mean, the most expensive part-we had the top statistician at the Medical School perform the statistical
analyses. That was great since I was no statistician. Basically I would write up
[the papers], and Keith would edit, and we’d go from there. He, from the
very beginning, complimented my writing and told me I was a great writer
55

and he was really excited about working with me since I created less work for
him. [laughter] The most expensive part was really the analyses of the blood.
That was an expensive laboratory procedure at that time. He used funding
that he had.
Marine-Street: The Medical School did the analysis of the blood?
Gartrell: [00:29:08] I have this vague recollection that it was actually sent out
somewhere. I think it may have been sent out.
Marine-Street: Were you using computers yet at this point?
Gartrell: [00:29:20] Computers? [laughter] We’re talking 1971 and 1972. Computers?
Marine-Street: How were you doing your work and your analysis?
Gartrell: [00:29:34] The laboratory analysis, that was done--I mean, there were things
like gas spectrometers. I actually would have to go back and look at how they
actually did that.
Marine-Street: I was just curious if you were using a computer lab or anything.
Gartrell: [00:29:56] No, I mean, access to computers was not something that I had
until 1986 or something. We’re talking 1970 to 1971. I mean, then the
concept of computer was something that was the size of half of Stanford or
something.
Marine-Street: So they’re doing all their calculations by hand? They’re not using punch cards
and feeding them into--?
Gartrell: [00:30:25] Whether the statistician did that in terms of her analyses, I don’t
know. That punch card concept I seem to remember it from back then for
testing and things like that--like SATs and stuff.

56

Marine-Street: I was just curious. Sometimes people remember quite well working with
those big mainframe machines before they had PCs.
Gartrell: [00:30:54] I remember quite well not having access to anything resembling
the computer.
Marine-Street: Did you say the statistician was a woman?
Gartrell: [00:31:01] Yes.
Marine-Street: Did you know her?
Gartrell: [00:31:03] I met her a number of times, Helena Kraemer [Helena Chmura
Kraemer]. She is a very distinguished statistician.
Marine-Street: Oh, very interesting.
Gartrell: [00:31:12] A very nice woman. A very wonderful woman.
Marine-Street: What was the outcome of the research? Did it gain any attention?
Gartrell: [00:31:20] Master’s and Johnson’s group got publicity all over the country.
That’s how we found out about it. But ours and a couple other studies that
followed that showed no differences or differences in favor of the gay men
didn’t get publicity at all, which then taught me, at that time, that the media
reported what they wanted to report that was consistent with stereotypes.
But, we were also right on the cusp of [the efforts to change the DSM]. Keith
was the program chair of the APA meeting that I think was held in Hawaii-the American Psychiatric Association--where there was a lot of confrontation
by gay male psychiatrists of the psychiatric establishment.
He also approved to have on the program a panel or something
related to homosexuality per se, which was probably focused on men because
it was probably men doing the presentation. I did the first one that was
57

focused on lesbians in 1975. In any case, this meeting, which, again, I think
was in Hawaii, was a time when there was a lot of attention to the issue of
removing homosexuality from the DSM because there was no research to
support a pathological diagnosis. In 1973, I’ll call it the first step of removal
occurred. [Homosexuality was removed from the DSM], and ego dystonic
homosexuality was [inserted instead]. It was a very long struggle to extract all
pathological references to sexual identity from the DSM. But, it was a great
victory in 1973.
All of the work that was happening right around that time, including
ours, contributed to this new understanding that there was no basis for the
pathological diagnosis. That did not mean that the culture just woke up and
said, “Oh, okay, right. Love your lesbian and gay neighbors.” No. “Let
lesbian and gay people who come out and divorce their opposite sex partners
and want to share or have custody of their children have their children.” No.
The cultural change was very slow in coming. The legal changes were very
slow in coming, but this was an incredibly important step in terms of the
whole concept of mental illness and homosexuality.
Marine-Street: Do you remember that time in 1973 when they decided to take that first step
to take it out?
Gartrell: [00:34:23] Absolutely. I mean, it was just vital. It was really vital. As I
mentioned, I had no sense that there was anything wrong with me from the
very beginning. My perception was it was all about the rest of the culture not
understanding that we could be okay. We were just like everyone else with
this exception. I was thrilled that the prospect of having that diagnosis
58

leveled at me, or ever finding myself in a situation where someone could
decide that they could involuntarily hospitalize me based on it, couldn’t
happen anymore. I, of course, didn’t understand fully then the ramifications
of living in a state like Texas, for instance, where involuntarily
hospitalizations continued to happen if family members just said, “Take this
person.”
Marine-Street: Right. Before we move on to med school, could you just tell me what Keith
Brodie was like?
Gartrell: [00:35:39] He was an incredibly supportive, beautifully articulate man,
psychiatrist, researcher. I was so thrilled to have had him as my mentor
because throughout my early years and subsequently all the way through my
career, [he was supportive of my work]. When I wrote a book in 2008 called
My Answer is No...If That’s Okay with You about the complexities of saying no
when you care about the relationship--something that I had spent my whole
clinical practice helping women and men who were concerned about setting
limits in relationships learn how to do--even that, which was really not related
directly to his work, he called me up with great enthusiasm about.
I know he did that for all of the mentees he had over the years. [He]
would write such lovely, supportive letters--handwritten letters. He could
have, in the computer era, just sent me an email saying “great job,” but he
didn’t. He would take the time to actually write out a letter saying, “You
know, I’m so proud of you. You’ve just done such great work, and I always
knew you could do these things, but you continue to impress me. You never
fail to impress me.” Or whatever. Anyway, he couldn’t have been nicer and
59

more supportive. He was very supportive of my early efforts with the APA
when I came in and pretty rapidly assumed some leadership positions in the
national APA. He was very supportive of all my political positions even
though they put me in immediate conflict with so many people.
Nevertheless, he never wavered in his support. He was on his way to
becoming president of the American Psychiatric Association and then first
chancellor and then president of Duke University. He wasn’t a career
politician in medicine or psychiatry in the sense that he chose to suppress
difference or a divergence of opinion from the majority. He supported
everything that I [pursued] in my career path--at least [when speaking] to me.
If he had a difference of opinion, he didn’t share it with me, and he never
tried to stop me from speaking out. That is an incredible thing. I mean here
was a man who had the potential to use--he came from a very privileged
background--his patriarchal power in a way that would be all about
conformity, and he never was.
[00:39:17] For him to choose to endorse and support a person who
started out just as a lesbian and became a radical lesbian feminist with all that
that entails, who took on the APA around sexual abuse of patients with all
that that entails, and so many other things, is really an incredible statement
about who he was.
Marine-Street: Well said. Let’s talk about med school. Why did you decide on UC Davis?
Gartrell: [00:39:58] Let’s see--multiple reasons. It seemed as though there were some
interesting opportunities in psychiatry. It was a rural area, and I’d had an
experience of being in an urban area and it seemed as though there was an
60

opportunity to see a less privileged population, a more rural population, and
a more economically diverse population. Those were factors that contributed
to my decision.
Marine-Street: Do you have any memorable coursework or training moments as you think
back to med school at UC Davis? Anything really stick in your mind?
Gartrell: [00:40:56] No. [laughter] There’s nothing about medical school that I actually
liked. It was just--it was hard work. It was very painful to see how patients
were treated by physicians. I didn’t feel that there was much empathy, much
willingness to really take time with patients. I tried to stay open in my career
choice to see if there might be something different from psychiatry that I
would have an interest in. The three areas that I was considering were
psychiatry, pediatrics--because pediatricians had to be nice to kids, otherwise
kids wouldn’t cooperate--and OB/GYN because I love delivering babies and
that was a wonderful experience for me. All the other fields, I felt patients
were disrespected. They weren’t treated like valuable human beings. That was
not inspiring to me.
What was inspiring [while I was in medical school] was a sidetrack,
which was my connecting to a lesbian community. There was no lesbian
community, no gay community [within medicine]. I didn’t know anybody else
at the Medical School who was lesbian or gay. I suspected that one woman
faculty was a lesbian but never had it confirmed. The Law School had
admitted, in a couple of years, a group of feminist law students. As law
students, they expected to be fighting throughout their careers. I went to a
film where I met one of those law students and then got introduced to more
61

of them and got connected to their community. That was fabulous because
that is what began my connection to what eventually became a radical lesbian
feminist community. Again, there was no internet. There were no national
[lesbian] newspapers. How did I find out about--from [a small town] in
California--the fact that there was a radical lesbian feminist, separatist
community in DC? Because one woman in this Law School group had been
involved with one of the women in the radical lesbian feminist community in
DC.
That was one thing. But also it was the beginning of our computer
network, which was the women’s music cultural movement. These were not
computers. These were humans. These were piano playing, guitar playing
lesbians who sang songs and went from little town to little town where these
music concerts were held. Through word of mouth, people found out about
them, and then we began to hear about the other communities that were
developing around the country.
[00:44:37] Dee Mosbacher [Diane Mosbacher], my spouse of fortythree years who’s also a psychiatrist and an Academy Award-nominated
documentary filmmaker, made a film about that historical movement called
Radical Harmonies. [It depicted] the story of the women’s music cultural
movement. It was life- transforming for me in the sense that I saw this
incredibly wonderful burgeoning community. We had a way of starting to
communicate from community to community. [Lesbian] newspapers [were
created] in these little communities--[sometimes] fliers or whatever, stapled

62

together--[various ways] of putting out news. The performers would tell us
about things that were going on in different communities.
Some of the women in these communities would travel to other
communities or follow these musicians, and the network just started to grow.
And also their songs were songs of pride and empowerment as women, as
lesbians. They also created this whole industry around the music that was
independent of the male music industry. Because they couldn’t get record
contracts because they were lesbians. Men in Hollywood and various other
places wouldn’t produce them because they were lesbians. They just started
doing it all themselves. They built the infrastructure from the ground up.
They learned how to do the sound recording. They learned how to make the
records. They learned how to distribute the records. It just went from there.
It was so inspiring to see what they were able to do.
So when I think back about role modeling, in terms of becoming
stronger and more confident in myself, I give tremendous credit to Keith
Brodie for enabling me to start on this path of research that I had already
determined was going to be my life’s work. And I give an incredible amount
of credit to this women’s music cultural movement and the many lesbian
communities with which I was affiliated for showing me that lesbians could
be strong and powerful. And then we had, of course, more self-defense
classes and so on. [Teaching us how to] fight back if we needed to. That
fortified me in just phenomenal ways as I was going forward and even before
I met Dee who has become my second backbone and my ally in absolutely
everything that I’ve done.
63

Marine-Street: That’s really interesting. Let me just ask you a couple follow-up questions
about that and then we’ll call it quits for today. Where did these concerts
happen?
Gartrell: [00:48:01] They happened in universities, in music halls, often in churches,
often in churches. They would rent the basement of a church and somebody
would figure out how to rent a sound system and, I mean, people learned to
become producers and then they became producers for many years. They
were in community centers and churches and wherever they could get a
space and mics and sound systems and chairs and get the word out through
fliers and so on.
Marine-Street: Do you remember any specific places at UC Davis or any specific performers
that you went to see?
Gartrell: [00:48:42] Oh, for sure. The performance at Davis was at one of the college
buildings, so somehow they got access to one of the college buildings. The
performers included Meg Christian, Holly Near, Margie Adam, later Sweet
Honey and the Rock. Oh, there are just so many. This Radical Harmonies film
features many, many of them. But they also led to these lesbian gatherings
where some of the writers and thinkers of the movement were coming
together and would give speeches.
I remember somewhere in the Sacramento area, there was a gathering
and people like Rita Mae Brown who was a member of the original Furies
Collective in Washington spoke, and like many people, I was just
mesmerized. “Oh my gosh, she can just get up and say all these powerful
things and talk about what we can do, and how we can control our lives, and
64

how we can do it all, and we don’t have to be dependent on men. We can
just do it as women and there’s nothing to stop us.”
Marine-Street: That’s a great place to end for today.

Marine-Street: This is Natalie Marine-Street with the Stanford Historical Society Oral
History Program. Today is August 31, 2018, and we are resuming our oral
history interview with Dr. Nanette Gartrell. You had mentioned that you had
remembered something else about the computer question I asked you last
time. Shall we start there?
Gartrell: [00:00:22] Yes, please. I was so surprised when you asked if I had access to a
computer in 1970 doing research. After we concluded the first part of our
interview, I sort of thought back to that particular study and I had a very
clear image of sitting on my dorm floor--I was an RA that year--sitting on my
dorm floor and in the first round, stuffing all the envelopes that were going
out to the psychiatrists in the Northern California Psychiatric Association.
Putting the stamps on and labels and all that sort of stuff.
The second was the tabulation because all of my research for the first
couple of decades was conducted through paper and pencil questionnaires,
aside from the blood draws. We mailed out these questionnaires. We got
67

them back and then I, with a couple of volunteers who were on my corridor
who were willing to participate, hand-tabulated. So we had all these stacks of
answers that we then double-checked each other. I took those numbers over
and gave them to the statistician who then crunched the data. From my
conversations with a statistician who worked under her, I’m guessing that
they did it with sort of calculators and things like that rather than the
mainframe computer at Stanford. I kind of doubt that but I have no idea.
Marine-Street: I know. They might have had punch cards. There were some kind of punch
cards and it could run the job..
Gartrell: [00:02:09] They were definitely hand tabulated. [laughter]
Marine-Street: I’m glad you remembered that. I always love to hear how people did their
research in the days before it was so easy to just load up your Excel
spreadsheet or your Math Lab or whatever. When we left off last time, we
were talking about the music scene at UC Davis and the Law School group
of feminists that you had found there. I wondered, were you aware of the
women’s movement at that time when you were in medical school?
Gartrell: [00:02:49] Definitely. I mean, Ms. magazine was already out, and I was very
excited about that. The women’s movement was influencing the lesbian
community as well. The lesbians whom I admired who were part of this
women’s music cultural movement were strong feminists and lesbian
identified. They were taking that message from community to community to
community, small town to big town to small town, all over the country and it
was wonderful.

68

Marine-Street: Did you have a word that you used to describe your politics or your identity
at that time?
Gartrell: [00:03:31] We didn’t combine the words lesbian and feminist. We just said we
were lesbians, and that was a very radical statement unto itself.
Marine-Street: What about feminist? Was that a term that you would have used to describe
yourself then?
Gartrell: [00:03:46] Yes, happily, but it’s just that in the ordinary sentence structure, it
was far more radical to say lesbian than lesbian feminist. Also the feminist
movement--there was a great resistance on the part of some women who
identified as feminists to having lesbians in the women’s movement. We were
considered the “lavender menace,” and there were great efforts to exclude
lesbians and any visible lesbian presence because they were afraid that the
entire women’s movement would be tarnished with the paintbrush of
lesbianism which, in their minds, equaled “women who hated men.” They
couldn’t conceptualize the fact that lesbians were lesbians because we loved
women and that it wasn’t a reaction to men. It was a reaction for women.
Marine-Street: Did you ever experience that kind of tension? Do you have any examples
that you can give me that happened in your own experience of feeling like
the feminist movement wanted to exclude lesbians?
Gartrell: [00:05:25] I had experiences in the American Psychiatric Association later
when I was in a leadership position with the Women’s Committee. Straight
feminists made bizarre assumptions about me as a lesbian or my associations
with colleagues whenever I would find another ally with whom I could work
on a particular project that was either groundbreaking or problem-creating
69

within the American Psychiatric Association because of its values. I had
people make comments to me along the lines of, “Oh, are you two lovers?”
when it was 1), never the case and 2), completely irrelevant to the project.
But the assumption was made that somehow if someone joined my “camp”
that person must be a lesbian, or I must be involved with that person.
Marine-Street: Yes, it was just something you wouldn’t necessarily assume if a woman had
joined a male colleague on a project. Why did they say “lavender menace?”
What was that about?
Gartrell: [00:06:45] Because very rapidly lesbianism became associated with the color
lavender. Our t-shirts became lavender. It just became a very popular color,
and I actually don’t know the origin of the connection of that color to
lesbianism but I’ve always loved the color lavender, I love the plant lavender,
and we painted our house various shades of lavender. I’m pretty happy with
the color. [laughter]
Marine-Street: Okay. You had started to tell me a little bit about this externship when you
were a senior medical student and it’s an important time in your life. Do you
want to just tell me that story of how you got to DC and what happened
when you got there?
Gartrell: [00:07:34] Yes. Keith Brodie and I had had many conversations about my
senior year in medical school--Keith Brodie, my mentor. I said I was really
interested in--he’d been at NIH--perhaps going to NIH. I didn’t know if they
had externships, which is doing an elective for a period of time for medical
students. He said, “Oh yes, they do.” I said I probably should do some work
in neurology because that would be helpful since I was already going into
70

psychiatry. I should drop back and tell a story about my psychiatry
interviews, but I’ll continue with this one first. He made a recommendation
of a particular program, and I applied and I was accepted.
I moved to DC in the summer of 1975 and through the lesbian law
group in Davis was connected with an opportunity to move into a house of
other lesbians where they had an empty room. I moved into this house where
it turned out the person who’s become the love of my life and my partner
and now spouse of forty-three years, Dee Mosbacher, was already living. We
jokingly say that we’re the only couple we know who moved in together
before we’d even met. [laughter] I got to know Dee and fell in love with her
and the rest is history there.
Working at NIH, I was doing neurology and also had the opportunity
to do a follow-up study on hormone measurements because all the
stereotypes don’t go away overnight regardless of how much research you
do. I was able to replicate the study we had done on men and measure
testosterone levels in lesbians and compare them to our straight cohort who
were Mormon women who were hoping to become pregnant.
We had a comparison group of DC, relatively radical lesbians [versus
the] relatively conservative Mormon women who were en route to
pregnancy. We found that all the testosterone levels were essentially in the
normal range for both groups. That was an interesting study that happened
during that time. One of the other things that happened while I was there--it
was a very exciting time for me to be in this dynamic, really progressive,
leftist in terms of their politics, anti-war, pro women, pro-choice, pro lesbian
71

community--really a group that was creating a lesbian identity. It was the
beginning of that era. It was very vibrant for me. It was also immediately
after J. Edgar Hoover had died. I mean, he died in 1972 and that’s when he
left the FBI--when he died. His presence didn’t leave the FBI, of course, and
the FBI had already an extensive program of surveilling any progressive
groups. Anyone they deemed to be a threat in any way, despite the fact that
it’s known that he, himself [Hoover], was a closeted gay person. They were
surveilling the lesbian community in DC in a big way. This was news to me
when I moved there. I had no idea that this kind of surveillance was
happening.
[00:11:49] I was present at some social gatherings where the
conversation stopped and someone started talking about, “What you do if
the FBI shows up at the door?” They talked about the fact that the lesbian
community was infiltrated by FBI informants and that they were certain of
that, they just didn’t know who they were. [They knew] because there were
often people who were asking questions about, “Who do you know?” or
“Do you know this person?” or “What can you tell me about that person?”
And so, although they didn’t have evidence, they felt very strongly suspicious
about those kinds of inquiries. Dee, herself, was working in the pro-choice
movement, and she suspected that she was being surveilled, despite the fact
that her family were very prominent Republicans. She grew up with the
Bush’s, and knew them well.
Dee’s uncle was Nixon’s protocol chief during that time. She still
suspected that she was being surveilled. At one meeting, we were told that if
72

the FBI ever showed up at the door, [we should] not answer any questions.
[We were advised to] say “I cannot answer any questions unless an attorney
is present.” I just thought, oh my gosh, here I am--I’ve come from small
town Santa Barbara, went to Stanford, I know we had the anti-war
movement and so on, but here I am in a community where the simple act of
loving another woman was cause for surveillance. The simple act of women
organizing for ourselves and not being about men was cause for surveillance.
That was deeply threatening to the power structure at the time. That was a
phenomenal [piece of advice] that I stored away.
It didn’t happen to us then. Fast forward to 1988. Here in our home
in San Francisco! We had not lived here very long when at seven o’clock in
the morning, the doorbell rang. I answered the intercom and somebody said-a man’s voice--said, “This is the FBI. We want to speak to Diane
Mosbacher.”
I started laughing. I happened to be up. I’m a morning person and
Dee’s not a morning person. She was up, but not fully caffeinated. She
wasn’t near the intercom. I said, “Okay, who is it? This is a joke. Tell me who
you are.”
The person said, “This is no joke, ma’am. This is the FBI, and I need
you to come to the door, and I want to speak to Diane Mosbacher.” She
goes by Dee.
I still couldn’t believe that this was actually happening so I called to
her, and I said, “There’s somebody who says that he’s the FBI, and he’s at
the door, and they want to talk to you.”
73

I don’t remember what year--I guess at whatever point the Freedom
of Information Act allowed us to get Dee’s and my FBI records--we actually
did apply for them. Much to my disappointment, I had no record. [laughter]
[00:15:25] Dee has a [thick] FBI file that [was] heavily redacted. Not only was
she pro-choice and working on pro-choice activism, but she had also joined
the Socialist Worker’s Party--[a long distance from] her Republican roots.
Both of those [activities], at that time, triggered a great interest in what she
must be up to. We went down to the door and unbelievably, there was a man
and a woman standing at the door in trench coats--I mean, this was like from
a 1950s movie--holding up badges that said FBI on them.
The man said, “We’d like to talk to you, Diane Mosbacher.” We
stood there and he said, “I have a few questions I’d like to ask since your
father has just been nominated to be Secretary of Commerce.”
She said, “I suspect that you want to know if I’m a lesbian. Yes, I’m a
lesbian.”
He said, “Does your father know that you are a lesbian?”
She said, “Yes, he does.”
He said, “Thank you very much” and they turned and walked away.
They got on a plane, flew to Houston, showed up at his door the
next morning--at seven o’clock in the morning or something like that and
said, “Do you know that your daughter is a lesbian?”
He said, “Yes, I do,” and then they walked away.

74

That FBI training from [our early years] actually [had some relevance
later] in our lives. I mean, Dee could see where it was going, but if it had
happened back then, it would have been an entirely different scenario.
Marine-Street: Did that go anywhere--his nomination as Secretary of Commerce?
Gartrell: [00:17:32] He became Secretary of Commerce.
Marine-Street: Was it an issue?
Gartrell: [00:17:35] Under H. W. [Bush]. Around the [time of the] 1988 election Karl
Rove came up with the idea of using homophobia as a fundraising tool for
the Republican Party. It generated a tremendous amount of concern about
“if we let the Democrats win, they’re going to let lesbian and gay people get
married and have civil rights and all these things.” In the course of the H. W.
[Bush] administration, the [Republicans] put out films [containing this
message]. Gay Rights, Special Rights was one of the names of these films,
[focused on] the “gay menace, the lesbian menace, we’re coming after you.
We’re going to take away your rights, and we’re going to get all the rights that
we don’t yet have and deserve.”
Dee made the decision to come out publicly on a national platform
to speak [about these issues]. She was the first lesbian or gay person who had
a parent who was a very high-ranking person in the administration to speak
out against the Republican Party’s homophobia--its gay and lesbian baiting
for the purposes of fundraising and discrimination against us. She got a
tremendous amount of publicity around all of that. That actually led into her
decision to make films for the purpose of educating about homophobia
because she felt she could reach a wider audience. Dee was on national
75

television and did a tremendous amount of public speaking during that time.
It catapulted her into taking on the Republican Party.
Marine-Street: Very interesting story. The FBI finally showing up at the door.
Gartrell: [00:19:50] In trench coats. [laughter] I mean, really, 1988, in trench coats.
Marine-Street: I want to go back to something that you said that really intrigued me, and I
hadn’t thought about this before. It’s the mid-1970s. You’re living in a house
of lesbians in Washington, DC and you’re saying you’re kind of trying to
figure out what does this mean? What is this identity that we’re kind of
creating? I wondered if you could relate any of the decisions that you made
about what this identity was? Was there a political component to it? Were
there places that you went, kinds of food that you ate? I mean, what was this?
Gartrell: [00:20:30] The sort of catch phrase that began back then that was so
characteristic of my life was that “the personal is political” and the personal
was political. In 1974 when I interviewed for residencies, I interviewed at
Harvard, Columbia, and Duke. Keith was at Duke and wanted me to go to
Duke and did so many wonderful things to try to convince me to go to
Duke. [For example], he thought that one of the women in his Department
of Psychiatry was likely a lesbian. I think she was a social worker. He went up
to her and said, “I hope you don’t mind my asking this question and there
will be no negative consequences to this, but it could be really helpful if you
would be honest. Do you happen to be a lesbian?” She was completely
shocked.
In North Carolina, it was very conservative back then. She said,
“Well, yes I am.” He said, “That’s fantastic because I have somebody I’m
76

trying to convince to come here to residency. I wonder if when she comes
for her interview, would you mind--do you have a community? Do you know
other lesbians? Is there any chance that you would be willing to introduce her
to other lesbians in this community?” They did [have a community there].
This [particular woman] had a farm and all these lesbians came over. It was
fabulous. It was just an amazing experience. That’s how hard he tried to get
me to go to Duke. I had already published papers. None of my peers
[applying to residency] had published papers. Again, now it’s really different.
Back then, [having publications already was] really unusual.
I did my interview at Harvard, and it was clear they wanted me. I
went to Columbia. I met with the department chair. He told me I was a shoein. They wanted me. “What could they do to convince me to be in the
program?” [he asked.] My last interview was with Robert Spitzer. He was the
architect of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. He was the
opponent of taking homosexuality out. He was the person who insisted on
retaining various versions of pathology associated with homosexuality, egodystonic homosexuality, various other things. He carried that kind of
[mission] forward for decades. He met with me for my interview. I sat down
in his office, and he said, “You’re clearly a lesbian so are you the butch or are
you the femme?”
I said, “I’m neither.”
He said, “Well, what do you do?”
His whole interview was about my behavior as a lesbian. It was
disgusting, horrifying, inappropriate. [I didn’t know what a person like me
77

could do in such a circumstance]. I left the interview knowing what the
department chair had already told me. I was [supposedly] a shoe-in.
[00:23:49] I walked to the cafeteria. My first lover met me in the
cafeteria. I sat down, and I told her the story of what had gone on and that
probably took twenty minutes. I said, “Let’s just get out of here. This
completely freaks me out that this man has done this to me.” I [had] refused
to answer many of the questions because they were so invasive and so
inappropriate. I turned to walk out of the cafeteria, and he was hanging in the
doorway watching us. He’d followed me to the cafeteria, and he was standing
there watching us. A few weeks later, I got a letter saying they were terribly
sorry that they couldn’t accommodate me at Columbia.
Keith, who was a Columbia graduate, called the department chair and
said, “So what’s going on here? She was told by you that you were admitting
her now you say you’re not.”
He was told by the department chair, “Well, we’re not admitting her
because she has a problem with her lesbianism.” The problem was I didn’t
think my lesbianism was a problem.
Marine-Street: Did you think it was because you didn’t want to talk about it? Was he
expecting you to be more forthcoming?
Gartrell: [00:25:11] No, I refused to consider it a problem. I was affirming of it. In a
homophobic, psychoanalytic, psychodynamic program such as what
Columbia was at that time, that didn’t fit with the protocol.
Marine-Street: But it had already been removed from the DSM by that point?

78

Gartrell: [00:25:35] But he was the opponent. That was a year later. One year later. He
was very unhappy that it was out of the DSM.
Marine-Street: Were you disappointed by that decision?
Gartrell: [00:25:48] I had already been accepted at Harvard. Despite Keith’s wonderful
offering of a great lesbian community at Duke [laughter], I’d had a taste of
living in a city, in DC for six months, and I wanted to have another urban
experience. I wanted to try out living on the East Coast. I chose Harvard.
Marine-Street: That’s a great story about Keith Brodie going out and finding the lesbians at
Duke for you.
Gartrell: [00:26:18] Thankfully that woman--it was just such a sweet thing to do--but
thankfully that woman ended up feeling really good about having said yes as
opposed to being terrified.
Marine-Street: That’s really funny. I want to get back and ask you a lot of questions about
Harvard and what that was like. But at the same time that this is happening,
you’re getting involved at the APA. I wondered if you could talk about some
of the different task forces that you worked on and some of the activist work
that you’re doing in that setting.
Gartrell: [00:26:53] So I went to Harvard for my residency, and, as a resident, I was
chosen to do an honorary fellowship with the American Psychiatric
Association, APA. That APA. One of them was to be on the task force of
the psychology of women and men and the other was to be on a lesbian and
gay task force. I ran into a lot of challenges immediately with both. The
gay/lesbian task force, I was the only woman. We would have meetings that

79

were part work-oriented and part--I don’t know--hitting-on-each-other
oriented.
Marine-Street: The men?
Gartrell: [00:27:54] The men. They were talking about their sexual exploits. It was just
so inappropriate. Just an example of one of those--they decided we would
have one of our meetings on Fire Island. We had meetings at the APA in
Washington and then we would have other meetings. They proposed one on
Fire Island. I had never been to Fire Island. Again, coming from not having
means, this was the first time I was actually earning an income. Oh good, [I
thought], Fire Island. I’d heard about it and thought, you know, how nice to
go see this place.
One of the people on the task force had a house on Fire Island, and
so we met in the house. I showed up in business attire. They were all wearing
short shorts or bathing suits. We met for a few hours again with a little bit of
work and a lot of sort of banter about sexual stuff and then broke at 11:00 or
12:00 for a so-called lunch break. I sat there while they went out and met
men. I mean, that was the lunch break. I was just mortified. It was just
horrifying to me.
The Task Force on the Curriculum of the Psychology of Women and
Men--we were assigned the responsibility of creating a curriculum on the
psychology of women and men. Everybody volunteered for various sections.
I volunteered for a couple. It was a small number of us--but that included
really prominent psychiatrists such as Jean Baker Miller.

80

I volunteered for the sexuality chapter. I wrote the sexuality chapter.
In the sexuality chapter and this was--I forget what year it was--1979 or
something like that. Or 1980. I wrote a single sentence that seemed to cause
tremendous difficulty once our group approved it all and submitted it to the
APA to be endorsed and adopted by the APA, and then used for curricula all
over the country--residency curricula and in medical schools.
“Homosexuality is a normal [form of] sexual expression.” Or
“Homosexuality is a normal expression of sexual affection.” Something like
that. That single sentence made the hierarchy of the APA go ballistic. 1973
and however many years later this is--1979-1980, somewhere around there-the APA hierarchy was unwilling to endorse a single sentence of this
curriculum. They said it had to be removed.
[00:31:15] There were a couple women who were moving up the
ranks of the APA and happened to be in my department at Harvard. They
took it upon themselves--without telling me--to rewrite my section of the
curriculum, including taking that sentence out. Then I was informed that that
had happened. I said, “That’s absolutely not acceptable.” [It was rewritten
under my name]. I said, “It is not acceptable.” I don’t know how I became
this assertive that rapidly, but I knew that you do not rewrite anyone’s
material and keep that person’s name on it without that person’s permission,
with the intention of publishing it and publicizing it. It’s not okay. It’s not
ethical. I said, “That’s absolutely not going to happen and there is no
justification when homosexuality has been removed from the DSM not to
have this totally vanilla sentence in this curriculum.”
81

Then they tried to talk me into it. “Oh well, you know, for the sake
getting the whole curriculum out, this is really important. What you’re doing
is you’re slowing this down. We need this curriculum out.”
I said, “I stand by my principles on this and the APA should stand by
the removal of homosexuality from the DSM.” That wasn’t going to happen.
It wasn’t going to happen. What I did was I said, “Okay, well then in that
case, I’m pulling my chapter, and I’m resigning from this task force.” Others
who had contributed chapters who were allies also did the same thing. They
included Jean Baker Miller and Joe Pleck [Joseph Pleck] who had written a
lot on men and masculinity--he actually has a book called Men and Masculinity-who was a great ally. And the most progressive women who’d contributed
to this curriculum pulled their chapters, and it was killed and it never came
out.
[00:33:57] So I was rapidly making myself an enemy of people in
power by being this assertive as a very, very junior person in the
organization. I said to you previously that Keith Brodie, as my mentor, even
though he was on the rise--I forget when he became president of the
American Psychiatric Association but it was somewhere close to that period
of time--he could have been another person who tried to suppress me,
especially because everyone knew that I knew him very well. He could have
said, “Oh, you’re causing so much trouble, you know, things don’t move that
quickly. Just take it easy. Do one thing at a time. It takes ten years to move
from this point to that point.” He never did that. If anything, I think

82

privately he was somewhat amused that I was willing to have that much
hutzpah.
Marine-Street: Wow. So I just want to make sure I understand. On the committee, there was
a divide about what you should do in terms of this sentence? There were
some allies that said we agree with you and others that said no, you should
change it?
Gartrell: [00:35:10] No, the committee itself completely supported it. But once it went
up to be approved in the hierarchy of the APA, then people who were on the
rise and people who were in positions of power all piled on--and then this
maneuver of rewriting my section.
Marine-Street: That was by people on the committee?
Gartrell: [00:35:33] Who were outside the committee. Who were already in the APA
hierarchy and on the rise in the APA hierarchy. Nobody within the task force
itself tried to rewrite my sentence.
Marine-Street: Did the task force just disband then or what happened?
Gartrell: [00:35:50] The curriculum was killed because the most prominent
contributors to it pulled their sections. I was not the most prominent
contributor, but I was the person who pulled my section and I wrote to
everybody else who was a task force member and also the prominent
contributors. And I said I’m resigning and I’m pulling my section and this is
not acceptable and they just followed suit.
Marine-Street: I want to just follow up on the lesbian and gay task force. Did you continue
to participate on that task force after the Fire Island, uhh, meeting?

83

Gartrell: [00:36:26] I don’t remember how much longer I was on the task force, but it
became clear to me that I worked much better in groups of women than in
groups of straight men when I was the only woman or gay men when I was
the only woman. I veered to the APA Women’s Committee. I was appointed
to join that committee, and they very rapidly figured out that it’s a good idea
to assign [projects to] people who get things done. Very rapidly after
residency, I found myself Chair of the National Committee of Women at the
American Psychiatric Association.
Marine-Street: What were some of your goals then? Before we get to that, I want to ask
about that but I think a little bit before that, you were very active in ERA
type activism. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about that.
Gartrell: [00:37:30] Nationally, women were trying to get the Equal Rights
Amendment ratified, and we were all in support of that. Because of the
obstacles, one of the strategies that was proposed through some prominent
feminist--and I don’t remember who but it could have been Gloria Steinem-was that large organizations that were intending to hold conventions in states
that had not yet ratified the ERA should pull their conventions and meet
only in states that had ratified the ERA. [The idea was] to have an economic
impact on states that had not ratified.
The American Psychiatric Association had 30,000 or so members.
We had big conventions. We were booked ahead in states that hadn’t ratified.
[When I was] a senior resident, the APA’s convention [was held] in Chicago.
[In our Boston] apartment, Dee [and I] tore up thousands of black arm
bands--with plumes of cotton [filling] the air--who knew that tearing up black
84

arm bands would lead to inhalation of all kinds of cotton dust?--to take to
the APA meeting as a symbol of supporting holding conventions only in
states that were ratified.
The following year was in San Francisco in 1980. I made a bunch of
signs and organized a picket outside the convention. I was an APA member
so I could go inside, but we also got Gloria Steinem to come and give a
speech. She was going to be speaking officially within the convention. We
hadn’t notified her that we were doing the demonstration outside. I just
believed in visibility because I’d been in enough demonstrations by then,
both lesbian and gay and women’s, that I knew that visibility and signs and
protests and pickets and so on were just really important. We had signs that
said, “Anti-ERA psychiatrists are bad for your mental health.” [We wore] the
arm bands again, and we encouraged everybody to wear white coats because
we thought that would be a good thing for visibility. I organized this
picketing outside the Convention Center here in San Francisco.
[00:40:43] Meanwhile, I was [living in] Boston, but this was here. We
got people to come from around the country and got as many medical
students as we could from here to join us because we needed bulk. We had
our picket going and then Gloria came early to give her talk, and she saw that
we were demonstrating, and so she grabbed a sign and picketed with us. It
got a fair amount of attention that we were doing this. They didn’t change
the [locations of the] next meetings, [so] we boycotted those meetings.
Didn’t attend them.

85

Marine-Street: Let me just ask a follow-up question to that because you said that you had
done previous demonstrations. I know you talked a little bit about being
involved in some anti-war but were there lesbian demonstrations or gay
rights demonstrations?
Gartrell: [00:41:38] Stonewall, the fighting back against the police harassment and
abuse of lesbian and gay people, had happened in 1969. Then the evolution
of Pride began to happen. Then we had positive demonstrations as well as
demonstrations against injustice. I was involved in organizing lesbian
physicians in Boston as a resident. Our group in Boston was called Dyke
Docs. I got people to [demonstrate]. I was always the sign maker, the arm
band tearer--I like making signs. I enjoy it if I have time. I don’t always have
time. I’m not an artist but I really enjoy putting nice, pretty letters on signs
and making signs. I’m an organizer at heart and I really like getting people to
follow through on commitments. I’ve been an organizer since way back then.
I’d make the signs and tell people, you know, to put out the word. “I’ll make
the signs. You just need to show up because I can’t carry forty signs.” So we
marched in the small and growing Boston Pride Parade. Again, many fewer
women than men, but I was just really working on increasing our visibility in
that way as well.
Marine-Street: That’s great. What else did the Dyke Docs group do other than march
sometimes in demonstrations?
Gartrell: [00:43:28] We would meet for potlucks. Most of the medical students were
closeted. I was the first out fulltime [lesbian physician] faculty member at
Harvard Medical School. I was trying to [help other] people feel comfortable
86

[enough] to come out because I’d already created a path where I found that it
was safe for me to be out. I knew that if I spent all my time making signs and
I didn’t attend to my patients or, you know, show up at the hospital or do
very good work or publish the requisite number of papers to put me on the
track for promotion, I’d be out of there in a nanosecond. I had to be very
good or probably better than my peers if I were going to be doing this visible
activism. There’s just no question about that. Fortunately, I was aware of
that, and I did my work well. I did my research very well because I cared very
much about it. I cared very much about my clinical work--trying to help
people be less self-hating about being lesbian and gay. That mattered
tremendously to me. I did this political work at the same time. I just lost
track of what the question was.
Marine-Street: I was just wondering what else the Dyke Docs did as an organization?
Gartrell: [00:45:10] We’d have potlucks and then my personal mission was to get more
people to come out and to figure out ways to feel safe in coming out.
Professionally, [that is], because they were out personally. Because there was
the importance of strength in numbers--I didn’t want to be the only one.
There needed to be more of us. How were we going to change things if I was
the only one? So that was the mission. Also I worked on trying to recruit
medical students who were on the cusp of coming out or feeling safer with
the prospect of coming out to come when I was teaching about homophobia
in medicine to medical students or to residents--I was giving lectures. [I
invited] them come [describe] their experiences of homophobia in medical
school.
87

I began to be very successful at finding a student each year who was
willing and brave enough to [tell her or his story]. The stories were just
heartbreaking about being assumed to be heterosexual and the kinds of
things that they listened to on a daily basis that were homophobic and harsh
and cruel and critical of lesbian and gay people because [these students] were
assumed to be members of the majority.
Marine-Street: I have a question that I want to ask you that might sound a little bit strange.
Professionally at work, you said you were the first out lesbian. How did you
kind of manifest that? How did you let people know? Or was it because of
your work and then if somebody asked you, you would just say yes? What
was the difference between--in a professional context--being closeted and
being out?
Gartrell: [00:47:08] First of all, when you were unique in that particular way back then,
you tell one or two people, and then there’s gossip that just spreads like
wildfire through the medical school and through the departments and so on.
It was, “Did you know that Nanette’s a [lesbian]?” I didn’t need to carry a
sign or put a label on my door, “Nanette Gartrell, MD, the lesbian
psychiatrist” or anything like that because everyone just seemed to know very
rapidly after I told a few people. And then a fair amount of the work that I
did and the groups I was involved with in Boston also brought media
attention. Sometimes there would be a Boston Globe reporter interviewing a
group of very prominent women psychiatrists, and I was lucky enough to be
a member of that particular group. I would talk about my perspective, [i.e.,
that of a lesbian psychiatrist].
88

One thing that was characteristic of me and my appearance was that
in looking at me--you know, I talked about back when I was an
undergraduate at Stanford, changing my attire from miniskirts to overalls and
turtleneck t-shirts and [wearing more] comfort clothes. We often talk about
the lesbian attire that evolved from those days, which was all about
comfortable clothes. If there was a lesbian uniform, it involved flannel shirts
and things like overalls and loose-fitting pants and Birkenstocks. It [wasn’t] a
stereotype. It was kind of the uniform. In some very rigid communities, if
you dressed like you were a member of the majority culture, there was
criticism for trying to “pass.”
When I entered residency, there were three women residents in my
program and all the rest were men. I already mentioned there were no
women on the faculty. Harvard had five psychiatric programs, and I was in
one of them. I was the only woman who wore pants throughout my
residency. The other women wore skirts. I dressed appropriately and nicely,
but [my clothing style] was radical for 1976 to 1979--to wear pants rather
than a skirt. [The pants were] the remnant of the lesbian uniform [laughter]
that I brought into my residency. When I joined the faculty, I had moved
into a [mindset in which] I decided I was just going to wear whatever I
wanted to wear. It was very, very hot in Boston in the summer and so I
started wearing skirts again some of the time. Just, you know, whatever felt
comfortable.
[00:51:15] Looking at me back then, you wouldn’t necessarily
immediately know that I was a lesbian based on what became the stereotype89

-and that was [then] accurate--of lesbian dress. Anybody who had not heard
the rumor the moment that it went out--when I started telling people about
being a lesbian--[wouldn’t necessarily know based on my appearance]. I very
often would have people come up to me--new faculty, new residents,
whatever--and ask me if I was married. Now back then, married meant to a
man. My response was always, “Oh no, I can’t get married because I’m a
lesbian, but I do have a partner.” Person after person had sort of the
immediate jaw-dropping response, had to reel it back up, and hemming and
hawing and sometimes blushing, [saying] “Oh my gosh, I didn’t know.” I
dealt with that kind of thing on a--well, there were new staff every year--so
that was kind of a routine.
Marine-Street: Did you face any kind of hostility or resistance on the Harvard faculty?
Gartrell: [00:52:27] Again, as long as I did what I was supposed to do, there wasn’t an
opportunity to get rid of me. My department chair at Beth Israel despised
every project that I was working on and really wanted to silence me. He was
incredibly resistant. He told me that I wasn’t going to get promoted doing
the work I was doing. He told me at one point I should not be using my Beth
Israel or my Harvard affiliation on any of my publications or when speaking
to the press because Beth Israel was a private hospital and it wasn’t
appropriate for me to identify myself as a member of the faculty. I can tell
the story of how I worked my way around that ultimately now if you would
like that.
Marine-Street: Yes, definitely.

90

Gartrell: [00:53:34] The president of our hospital at that time was Mitch Rabkin
[Mitchell T. Rabkin]. He’s an emeritus professor at Harvard now with whom
I have been in contact fairly recently. I decided that if I was going to
continually be told by my department chair--who had, by the way, refused to
put me up for promotion when I had twice the number of publications
required and more than my peers who had been promoted who were male;
and I had to push for that in order to be promoted--if I was going to
continually run up against his brick walls and comments that I shouldn’t
identify myself as working there, that I was going to go to the president of
the hospital and just ask, “Is this really the case?” Because if it is the case,
then so be it. I’m still going to do the work I’m going to do. Everything I
worked on was controversial at the time that I started it so it was still going
to garner publicity. So I might as well just find out and then I’ll go about my
business. I wanted to find out from someone who wasn’t [more concerned
about] protecting himself than thinking about maybe the institution as a
whole. And also it would be a sad statement about the institution as a whole
if that were the case.
I made an appointment to meet with the president of the hospital. I
hadn’t met him before. I guess I just sent my CV and walked into his office
and introduced myself. I’d been there for some number of years at the time I
did this. I said that I didn’t know if he’d had an opportunity to review my
work, and he said yes, he had.
I said that I was there because I had been told that the nature of my
work, the topics I studied and the focus of both my clinical work, the kind of
91

teaching that I was doing, and my research was not in keeping with the image
that Beth Israel and Harvard Medical School wanted to convey, and that I
was advised not to use my Harvard and Beth Israel affiliations on my
publications or when speaking to the press. He said, “That is absolutely not
the case. Your work is outstanding. It’s a contribution to our institution-both our institutions--to have you on the faculty and you absolutely should
feel free to [specify your affiliation with] Beth Israel and Harvard Medical
School in going forward.” Essentially, [meaning], “It’s not an issue that
you’re a lesbian doing the work that you’re doing.” I was ecstatic.
I couldn’t believe that he had just endorsed every part of who I was,
and I promptly went out to all the closeted physicians that I knew who were
working in our hospital and elsewhere in the Harvard system and contacted
them and said, “You can come out now. It is safe for you to be out. Mitch
Rabkin just said it’s okay for me to be a lesbian doing this work. You’re not
even doing the kind of work [I am, meaning research on and clinical work
related to LGBT people], but you can come out. It’s okay.” Slowly, one after
another after another came out.
Marine-Street: Did the department chair--was there any blowback from him when you went
over his head?
Gartrell: [00:57:31] I didn’t go back to him and say, “Oh, by the way, Mitch Rabkin
says--.”
Marine-Street: You just went ahead and did what you were going to do and eventually you
gained promotion?

92

Gartrell: [00:57:46] Yes, because I fought for it. I did know that there already was a
long history of women who were trying to get tenure everywhere in the
country having to fight for tenure typically. So I knew about that already. It
was just no different there for the Medical School faculty, in terms of
promotions.
Marine-Street: Let’s take a break.

PART:

4 OF 5

Marine-Street: I’d like to hear a little bit more about Dyke Docs, and I know you’d like to
talk a little bit about the terminology and how that evolved.
Gartrell: [00:00:11] Just a few words about terminology. When I was growing up, the
words “homosexual” were used clinically and also the words “queer” or
“homos” were used derogatorily. As I came out, I identified as a lesbian and
there was an early separation in the identification of women as lesbians and
men as gay--and particularly by women who were really proud to be out
identifying as lesbian. Those who were hesitant about being out chose the
word “gay” as a self-reference because I think they thought it seemed maybe
happier or something. [laughter]
As the community and time evolved, a lot of words that were used in
derogatory ways and homophobic ways in the past were reclaimed by our
community and acceptable to be used within our community but not by
outsiders. In calling ourselves “the Dyke Docs” in Boston, that was
reclaiming of a derogatory term, “dyke”, which I hadn’t heard as a child but
95

had certainly heard it subsequently. We organized in Boston as this group of
Dyke Docs and, as I mentioned, I was also trying to get people to come out
and also trying to get young medical students--actually senior medical
students--to speak in classes I was teaching, [to talk] about their experiences
of homophobia within medicine when they were assumed to be heterosexual.
In 1984, I received a letter from two physicians in California, Patty
Robertson [Patricia Robertson] who was at UCSF, a very prominent
professor of neonatology now and Lesley Anderson [Lesley J. Anderson],
who is an orthopedic surgeon, inviting me to what they called the first
National Lesbian Physician Conference to be held in Asilomar, California,
and to be the keynote speaker--speaking on the importance of being out. I
thought, “Wow, what an opportunity.”
So, of course, I went and did my keynote speech to a very small
conference. That conference has been alive ever since. It’s an international
conference. Sometimes we have as many as three hundred attendees from
various places, mostly in the United States but also internationally. Dee and I
organized the second such conference. I have spoken at many of them on
many of the different areas of research that I’ve been involved in. Dee has
both spoken and had leadership positions and also shown her documentary
films at various of the conferences. It’s an all-volunteer organization. We do
get continuing medical education credit, but it’s members of our lesbian
physician community who actually take hundreds of hours every year out of
their time to make these conferences happen. It’s kind of an amazing
experience that it still exists all these years later.
96

[00:03:44] We give scholarships now to medical students. Those of us
who are older contribute money for scholarships. We have these young
medical students who have no [lesbian physician] role models whatsoever [at
their schools] who come to our conferences, and they’re just in awe and feel
so empowered and thrilled. Just as an example, our most recent conference
was a few weeks ago in Napa. We had two young lesbian medical students
from West Virginia--the first time that I know of we’ve ever had any
attendees from West Virginia--who came. It was like a life-saving experience
for them. It’s just wonderful to see the kinds of opportunities that we were
able to provide [in mentoring, networking, and peer support].
We also give scholarships for research and for career development to
both medical students and residents and junior faculty. We have become a
very supportive organization for those who are up and coming as lesbian
physicians and medical students and trainees.
Marine-Street: I was curious about the name of that group.
Gartrell: [00:05:10] Women in Medicine. It’s a euphemism for lesbian physicians,
which I say is a euphemism for Dyke Docs. [laughter] Women in Medicine
was chosen because there was a great fear that those who were closeted
wouldn’t come to a conference called Lesbian Physicians--and they certainly
wouldn’t come to a conference called Dyke Docs--so it stuck. I think maybe
at some point it might change although we now have the archives of our
conference from all the way back to the beginning. They have been acquired
by Drexel University Medical School. There may be an interest in
maintaining the name because of the historical connection to the beginning.
97

Marine-Street: Are there any particularly memorable moments from any of your annual
meetings or conferences?
Gartrell: [00:06:05] Since, once again, I tend to be the person who’s talking about the
radical topics even in my group of peers, I’m, once again, bringing up the
topics that people don’t generally enjoy hearing about. That seems to be my
mission in life. There are two topics--we’ll get to my thirty-two year and
counting National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study. They’re thrilled with
that study. So many of them are moms, and they’re just so happy that I’m
doing the study. My work related to sex abuse by physicians led to my
decision to give a talk in I believe it was 1992 or 1993 at Women in Medicine
on ethics and boundaries for lesbian physicians because we already knew
from data that had been gathered that female-female cases were the second
highest percentage of reported abuse cases. The majority were male
physician/male therapist-female patient. Going way, way, way, way down in
the percentages but the next highest category--thirteen percent of cases--were
female-female. I knew of cases. They had come to my attention. They were
just as abusive and just as damaging to the patient as any other case of abuse.
I stood up in front of this group, and I talked about why we needed
ethics codes and why we needed to be just as vigilant in our own community
as we expect our male colleagues to be in the community of physicians. Then
I gave case example after case example which were, I think, really eyeopening and horrifying to members of the audience. I was asked to repeat
that [presentation] or do an updated version of that presentation this year. I
was asked actually before the #MeToo movement started. The #MeToo
98

movement became the backdrop of the talk that I just presented a few weeks
ago.
When the Q&A happened at this talk, lesbian physician after lesbian
physician stood up who had been there in the first talk and said, “I remember
when you gave your first talk. It was eye-opening for me. It changed the way
I practiced. It changed the way I understood the dynamics of power abuse.
One of the messages that you’ve said very clearly is that we, as women, very
often think we don’t have the power to abuse but, in fact, we do. I learned
that from you then, and I hope you young people here learn that again or
learn that for the first time from her today.” That was one example of a very
radical presentation in my own group that was already a radical group.
[00:09:54] Another was in 2002. My dear, dear friend, one of my best
friends on the planet [is a] brilliant professor, Dr. Esther Rothblum. I asked
her if she would be willing to speak with me at our conference. She’s been a
professor of psychology and LGBTQ+ studies and feminist studies and
everything associated, [and she is at] San Diego. She really created the
academic community around fat [studies, studying fat] phobia and fat
oppression. When I was at UCSF--I was on the faculty at UCSF for twentythree years--one of the things that I taught about was fat phobia in medicine.
I happen to be a thin person, and she happens to be a fat person and
[justifiably proud of her body].
[I have given] lectures [about] fat shaming by physicians and the
uselessness of advocating diets to people who already are contending with
their struggles around weight. The shaming of people for being fat--it
99

happens routinely in medicine--is so appalling. It occurred to me that it was
really not so different from what homophobia used to be like. I decided that
I would speak to our Women in Medicine conference in a plenary session
about that concept. I invited Esther to do it with me. I as a thin, she as a fat
woman and expert in the field. The reaction was intensely negative. In the
Q&A, [we focused on] discrimination. [We also talked about the fact that we
don’t] have a way of predicting whether, if you’ve been fat your entire life,
[and have no health problems, whether there are any specific healthassociated risks for you as an individual. Researchers don’t study healthy fat
people longitudinally].
Nobody [has done] it cleanly--[separating healthy fat people from fat
people with medical problems], but there is a multibillion dollar diet industry
that’s based on having people get onto diets and lose weight and then gain
back more weight. There’s so much that’s been documented about that.
[Healthcare professionals’] discrimination [against fat people] was not helping
patients at all. All it was doing was pushing people away from decent
healthcare, which is perhaps what [some] physicians want to do--[discourage
fat patients from making appointments to see them]. [Some physicians don’t
like] taking care of fat people [because of their own prejudice]. [Back to our
conference--the audience] reaction was [intense]--people were ready to
pounce. And our colleagues--[many from prominent] medical schools--[said],
“But being fat causes diabetes” and [the like]. We knew that was coming.
I said in the Q&A, “First of all, we’re happy to have comments from
any of you but you must, before a question or statement is made, state what
100

your feeling is based on hearing what we’ve had to say.” Hands shot up.
They went right into, “I feel that you don’t understand that being fat is going
to cause diabetes.” I would just stop [them] and say, “I’m sorry. I’m a
psychiatrist. I’m really going to be the police person here. That’s not a
feeling. A feeling is, ‘I feel anxious. I feel stressed. I feel upset.’ And why?”
They would then try again, put the word “feel” in, and come [back] with a
statement. I just wouldn’t let them ask the questions or make the statements
until they actually said, “I feel really uncomfortable” or whatever or “It’s
stressful to associate the way we’ve been treated as lesbian and gay people
and the way fat people are being treated.”
Anyway, it was a very powerful and very painful presentation and
very radical for this group. I haven’t been invited to do it again. At this point,
half the country’s fat. Even though discrimination continues, half the country
is fat so [a lecture like that might result in] a bit of a different scenario, in
terms of the kinds of comments, perhaps, that might be made.
Marine-Street: Could you remind me about when that was?
Gartrell: [00:15:09] 2002.
Marine-Street: 2002. What an interesting story. One more question about the Women in
Medicine group before we move on. Are there any sort of traditions at the
meetings or the conferences that you have observed?
Gartrell: [00:15:20] Oh, there’s so many traditions. [laughter] I mean, traditions
involve graduations and honors. We honor those who are graduating. We
honor those who’ve won awards, like [when] they [receive] endowed chairs
or professorships. We have our opening night where we go around and
101

everyone introduces themselves and says something about themselves. We
have an opportunity to see where people are from and meet people as a
group. T-shirts are made for each conference based on the location. There
are sporting activities like kayak rides and--depending on where we are--hikes
and, when we were in Napa, winetasting. So there are wonderful socializing
activities.
There is also a lot of thoughtfulness put into the mentor-mentee
relationship. Every medical student is assigned a mentor. This is [an] allvolunteer [effort].
Marine-Street: That’s amazing. We had started talking about the APA and your work on the
Committee on Women. I know that that led into an important research focus
for you. Can we talk a little bit about that now?
Gartrell: [00:16:41] Yes, when I became chair of the Committee on Women, my
understanding of the responsibility was--this was 1982--to advocate for
women’s mental health on a national basis. So that if there was a problem
related to women’s mental health, it was the responsibility of the Committee
on Women to figure it out and do something about it. Very soon after I
assumed the position, I heard that the number of malpractice claims filed
against psychiatrists through the American Psychiatric Association’s
insurance carrier --they had an insurance carrier at that time--based on
allegations of sexual abuse of the patient, were skyrocketing.
At that time, we were coming off the 1960s and 1970s, the free love
era, [aka] anything goes. There were no ethics codes. There were no licensing
board regulations. There were no laws about this. For me and for those on
102

my committee, it was a no-brainer. Your patients are not there for you to
have sex with. Your patients come to you because they have psychological
difficulties for which they need help. We started looking into this, and we
were getting more and more information about this as a potential problem
but by then, I was already quite wise to the fact that the APA was [laughter]
an institution in which there was a tremendous amount of resistance to
change and that it seemed unlikely that we could do anything about the
problem that we were hearing about until we had evidence documenting it.
I proposed that we put together a questionnaire, and get the APA to
agree to send it out to all the psychiatrists in the country and do it in a neutral
fashion because, again, there were no ethics codes, there were no laws, there
were no licensing board regulations. With nothing in place saying it’s not a
bad thing, you could just ask the questions in a neutral way and maybe
people would answer the questions. Have you been sexually involved with a
patient? If you have, how long did the relationship last? Is it still ongoing?
Questions like that and then we got a little further into it. Have you been
involved with more than one patient? How many patients have you been
with and can you tell us how many patients you’ve been involved with? We
put together this questionnaire.
We submitted it through the channels, and we were stonewalled by
committee after committee after committee that was responsible for
approving projects like this. [We were] starting to get accusations like, “What
[are you] trying to do? [You are] going to destroy the credibility of the
psychiatric profession.” We were going to destroy the credibility of the
103

psychiatric profession? To us, it seemed as though psychiatrists who were
sexually abusing their patients were destroying the credibility of the
psychiatric profession. We continued to push forward and said we didn’t
agree and we wanted to do this survey and we wanted the APA to sponsor it.
At a certain point, it became clear that it was re-cycling back through the
same committees that had already rejected it.
I had brought onto the Committee on Women, Judith Herman,
who’s my really good friend and colleague, and Silvia Olarte, another
psychiatrist. There were other members of the committee who were very
much in support of this project.
[00:20:54] We decided we would give the APA a deadline. If they
didn’t approve the project by this deadline, we would do the study ourselves
independently. They actually didn’t imagine that I could get the mailing labels
in order to send out the questionnaire to psychiatrists in the country because
this was--again--before everyone had computers in their homes, and they
owned the mailing labels for the Psychiatric Association. I don’t know how
they printed them out when they needed them--I don’t remember whether
they printed envelopes or labels or what they had. They just figured they’d let
the deadline pass and that it was a false statement on my part that I could
actually do it independently. But what they didn’t know is while we were
waiting for the deadline, first of all, I’d contacted two individuals at the
Harvard School of Public Health about doing the statistics. And that
continuing medical education was beginning to be a booming and profitable
industry. So we were starting to get mailings about continuing medical
104

education courses. They were coming through the AMA. I was never a
member of the AMA because--talk about organizations that were never
progressive enough for me--that was certainly one of them! The AMA was
located in Chicago. I contacted the Harvard Continuing Medical Education
Office, and I said, “When you’re sending out CME courses, how do you get
your mailing labels? Do you have your own?” They said, “No, no, we get
them through a clearinghouse through the AMA in Chicago.” And they gave
me the number. I already had plans to conduct a course on ethics in
medicine and in psychiatry and so I had already been kind of thinking along
these lines. I contacted this clearinghouse, and I said, “I’m a Harvard faculty
member and I’m planning to do this course and how would I obtain mailing
labels?” I [also asked], “How many do you have for psychiatrists?” I think
they had 25,000 or something. I said, “And how much would that cost?” It
was very expensive.
Every study that I’ve done, I’ve essentially funded myself out of my
own earnings. I said, “Well, could you randomly select every fifth psychiatrist
in the country, and how much would that cost?” And they said, “Oh yes, it’s
not a problem.” That was several thousand dollars, but I was willing to pay
for it. They said, “We’ll give them to you zip code sequenced, which, as it
turned out, is a very big deal because when you’re taking things in bulk to the
post office, which I did not know previously, you have to put them in bags
[that are] zip code sequenced. I got all those arrangements made. The
deadline came and passed. I contacted the clearinghouse. I got the labels

105

shipped to me; again, sitting on the floor--always I was seemingly [sitting] on
hardwood floors stuffing envelopes after printing out questionnaires.
[00:24:16] We had thankfully moved away from mimeograph into
being able to have Xerox copies back then. [I spent days] stuffing these
envelopes, putting stamps on them, getting them to the post office. We sent
them out to every fifth psychiatrist in the country. Officials at the APA went
ballistic when some of them received this questionnaire. They thought I had
broken into the APA and stolen the labels, gotten into the office and stolen
the labels! They had no idea that I could possibly do this without breaking in.
I assured them that I had a plan to conduct a course based on the results of
the study. They were just apoplectic about this. We got the questionnaires
back. We also got some that said things like, “We believe you have secretly
coded these questionnaires, and there is no circumstance in which I would
fill it out because I believe you can identify us.” We received back a lot of
obscenities and very hostile comments.
Leaving aside the obscenities and the blank questionnaires that they
sent back that we had to pay the postage on, of course, because they often
stuffed them with heavy things so we had to pay more postage, we tabulated
our results. Seven percent of psychiatrists acknowledged being sexually
involved with their patients and a number of those had been involved with
more than one patient. All our publications are available to be read so I’m
not going to go into details of numbers. They can be downloaded also--many
of them--on our study websites. We then had the issue of publishing the
article. The preeminent journal of psychiatry is the American Psychiatric
106

Association’s journal, the American Journal of Psychiatry. The editor of that
journal was none other than my department chair who wanted me not to use
my hospital affiliation and my Harvard affiliation on any of my publications.
They did not have anonymous review, of course. One of the things I’d
worked on for years was to get medical journals to have anonymous review
because all the data that we had showed that if even a single woman was a
co-author, the chance of an article being accepted was reduced.
We wrote up the first paper and submitted it to the American Journal of
Psychiatry. It’s standard to send out a manuscript to two reviewers, sometimes
three reviewers. He sent it out to seven simultaneous reviewers. We got
seven pages-long criticisms of us--not of the study--nothing about the
analysis or anything about the legitimacy of the actual research itself. We sat
down and typed up [our responses], dutifully responding to every criticism.
The one that was most entertaining to us--“These data could not possibly be
accurate. There’s no way that they could be accurate.” To that one, we
responded, “We completely agree with you. These data are not accurate.
They can’t even begin to be accurate because they inevitably underrepresent
the prevalence of this abuse.” They weren’t prepared for that [laughter].
My final statement in our very long, many-page response to these
criticisms [that was sent] back to the editor of the journal who happened to
be my department chair was, “We understand if the reviewers and you make
a decision that you do not want to publish it, but it’s important to let you
know that the American Psychological Association’s journal has expressed an
interest in publishing this article.” Which [would] essentially [be] letting the
107

competitor put out the information about psychiatry. I mean, I didn’t say that
but that was obvious. Very reluctantly it was published [in the American
Journal of Psychiatry].
[00:28:57] We then did a number of follow-up studies including
studying senior residents--all senior residents--in terms of their sexual
involvement with patients and already there were some who were sexually
involved with patients. I heard endlessly from psychiatrists, “Why don’t you
survey the other specialties? OB/GYNs, surgeons, family practitioners,
internists? Surely they’re sexually involved with patients too,” as if that
justified anything. When I [joined the UCSF faculty], I gathered colleagues in
other fields and, in fact, we did that study too. And, in fact, found [that], yes,
indeed, [physicians in other specialties were abusing patients too]. Also from
their own assessment of the impact on patients who had been sexually
involved with non-psychiatric physicians whom they knew of, that the
consequences were always damaging to the patients.
We knew from data we had been gathering over the [prior] decade
that most patients who were abused by psychiatrists [or other mental health
professionals] ended up severely depressed when the relationships
terminated, which they did inevitably. Ten percent were psychiatrically
hospitalized and one percent committed suicide. We even had people write in
things on their questionnaires like, “You know, I’m not really sure that this
involvement is worth the effort. This patient was terribly dysfunctional to
begin with and things just got worse after the sexual involvement so I’m not
really sure that this is something that I’m going to continue.” This is what we
108

were dealing with. The point of all of this was we had a mission, a mission to
establish ethics codes, to have licensing board regulations that made it very
clear that sexual involvement with any patient was unacceptable. Our mission
[encompassed] any current or former patient. We don’t have that in all the
regulations, but it has also become a felony in many states. And there are
reporting regulations in some states that if you, as a medical professional,
hear of another colleague who is involved with a patient, however you hear
about it, you’re required to report it to the licensing board. We have had a
great impact in terms of change. It was a hard-fought battle and a really
important one from my perspective, in thinking about the vast number of
patients who were severely damaged--[creating] what we call an iatrogenic
problem--caused by a medical intervention, which [in this case] was an abuse.
Marine-Street: That’s just incredible to me that it wasn’t part of the code of ethics. When
did it finally get into the code of ethics? Do you know?
Gartrell: [00:32:00] There were a lot of different changes to the ethics codes, and it’s
now in the AMA Codes of Ethics. It wasn’t part of academic codes of ethics-faculty/students--either.
This is all the result of the work that we did in this area [first in]
psychiatry and then [in] medicine that it became something that was then
[considered] in academia [concerning] faculty and students. I mean, you
know, the whole concept of “they’re both adults, it’s freedom of choice, it’s a
consensual relationship”--in medicine, we know what informed consent
means and I have said this very clearly since I began this work. Informed
consent means you explain the risks and benefits of any [proposed treatment
109

or intervention]. I can assure you there’s never been an abusing physician
who has explained that “you have a fifty percent chance of a severe
depression, ten percent chance of psychiatric hospitalization, one percent
chance of committing suicide as a result of this--your imminent sexual
involvement with me. [So] let’s go meet at the Holiday Inn.” I mean, does
that sound likely? No. Faculty/student involvement, I mean, [it’s important
to think about] who [holds the power]. We’ve talked about the all-male or
predominately male academic institutions in which I grew up. Many of those
individuals themselves likely were either aware of or themselves participating
in the abuse of power that we [now] know was rampant.
Marine-Street: Just the fact that someone would actually be truthful on the questionnaire
and return it to you would seem to indicate that there was some degree of
acceptance.
Gartrell: [00:34:07] Acceptance because we were just coming off the free love
movement when it was [considered] okay. In fact, when I was at Stanford,
for classmates who got involved with faculty members, that was a badge of
honor for them because what did they get out of it? They had a ticket to
opportunity, for a time.
Marine-Street: Was that frequent when you were at Stanford?
Gartrell: [00:34:35] I know of circumstances. Frequency--I would not be surprised if it
were frequent, but my mission was to get us out of the DSM back then.
Marine-Street: Right. I was just curious. Are there any examples that you encountered that
you would be able to share regarding this physician abuse?

110

Gartrell: [00:36:25] Yes. When I was a senior resident at Harvard, I spent half of my
time at Harvard Student Health Services. I’d only seen very, very, very
mentally ill patients [in my residency education at the state hospital]. I was
interested in working with healthy lesbian and gay people and helping them
with their [internalized] homophobia. Having a lot of expertise in how to
treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder
and so on really wasn’t going to be helpful to me in terms of dealing with
healthier people with run-of-the-mill problems. I wanted to work with
healthier people.
I applied for and was accepted for doing part of my senior residency
at Harvard Student Health Services. My supervisor there was Paul Walters. It
became clear to me that he was doing something that wasn’t okay while I was
there. This was 1979. He was an analyst. He had a sofa in his office. It was a
dark blue sofa. It had stains all over it. For supervision I met in there. I sat in
the chair and when all the residents met in there, we sat all around. I always
was trying to get the chair rather than the sofa. [I noticed that when he saw]
patients, they seemed to stay for a very long period of time. It just felt creepy.
Those were my observations. I started doing the research on sex abuse by
psychiatrists. We had two people from Harvard School of Public Health
whom we were working with, and through other people at the Harvard
School of Public Health and my networking around Harvard, I met some
people who worked at the Harvard Risk Management Foundation. I don’t
know if that’s a concept that is familiar to people, in general, so I’ll just say
something about it. Basically, they managed the malpractice claims that came
111

in against Harvard doctors, which meant they shoved them under the rug as
much as possible or did payoffs that were private or confidential because
nobody wanted bad publicity against Harvard doctors.
[00:39:23] I heard from somebody I really trusted, who was a really
straight arrow person who worked with the Risk Management Foundation,
that a claim had come in against Paul Walters for sexually abusing a Harvard
student, having her pay him thirty-five dollars a session, I think it was, for
oral sex three times a week as therapy, [and it had somehow been “taken care
of” by the Risk Management Foundation]. I was already working on sex
abuse. That individual said to me, “If this comes to your attention in any
other way”--because this was a breaking of a confidence as a person working
with the Risk Management Foundation--“you need to pursue it.” Before I
left Harvard, I still had some friends who were on the staff at [Harvard
Student] Mental Health Services where he still was. I said to them, “If you
hear anything about Paul Walters behaving sexually inappropriately with
students, you need to let me know.”
Before I left Harvard to move to California in 1987, he called me.
Paul Walters, out of the blue. I had had no contact with him since 1979. Oh,
[actually] I had. [Colleagues and I] had done a presentation at the American
Psychiatric Association on sexual abuse of patients after we had published
the first paper. He was there sitting in the front row. There were a whole
collection of people [in that row]. I recognized him, but there were others
that none of us recognized sitting in the first row of this huge auditorium. He
called me after that and he said he wanted to let me know that he was leaving
112

his position at Harvard, and he was moving to California. Where? To
Stanford to become the director of Cowell Student Health Services. I said,
“Oh, well, why are you telling me?” He said, “Well, when I was out there, I
mentioned that I knew you and that you were one of my supervisees and that
you went to Stanford.”
Now my work had already been publicized in a big way. I mean, front
page stories in the Boston Globe, the sex abuse stuff--the results of the
findings. It was clear he had used me in some kind of deceitful way to help
get a position at Cowell Student Health Services. I left Harvard. Moved out
here. The first year I was here, I got a call from one of the social workers
who was still on the faculty at Harvard [Student Health] saying they got an
anonymous letter from a woman who made the same claims--$35 an hour, da
da da da da. I said, “Thank you very much. I’m filing a complaint with the
Massachusetts Licensing Board and the California Licensing Board. I’m
going to inform them.” So I did.
Both began a major investigation. The story became front page news
out here and in Massachusetts. He left his position at Cowell Student Health
Services. He claimed that he had a substance abuse problem, and he tried to
get into a diversion program which, if you get in a diversion program, they
drop all charges against you--it’s a nifty, sneaky loophole for perpetrators.
Somehow there was enough publicity around it that they didn’t allow him
into it. He went underground and was never found again. Every few years I
got a call from a San Jose Mercury news reporter who was trying to find him;
[the reporter] was pretty convinced that [Walters, who] was from North
113

Carolina, had gone back [there] and changed his name and was working
[there]. I actually was very fearful that my name would come out as the
person who reported him to the licensing board. All I had done [was to say],
“This has come to my attention. Please investigate and please contact the
Harvard Risk Management Foundation and make sure you start your
investigation there.”
[00:44:40] When they did, the risk management people I guess were
obligated to contact Patient A who then said, “I’m willing to be named,”
which was amazing. So I was never publicly [named] on any of the press
about it, which I was very grateful about because I was afraid he was going to
come [after me and] kill me--literally. I was afraid because we already knew
that psychiatrists who took care of patients who’d been abused--women
psychiatrists who took care of patients who had been abused--these were
colleagues and friends of mine--had their offices broken into, their offices
vandalized, and their records stolen because they were encouraging and
supporting these women in filing complaints.
The perpetrators were trying to stop the complaints from happening
by attacking the subsequent treating women psychiatrists. These were scary
times. I was afraid that this guy whose misdeeds I had reported, [resulting in
a huge] impact on his career, was going to come after me. Fortunately, I was
not [named] by the media but the Patient A contacted me and said, “I don’t
know how you found out but it’s [been] life-changing for me that you did--in
a positive way--and I want to thank you so much for [having done] this.”
When it was publicized in Boston, [she was] Patient A, [and subsequently]
114

Patient B, [and] Patient C [and] I don’t know how many [others] came
forward and were willing to be named on the complaint. That’s one horror
story.
Another is the psychiatrist that my mother saw from the time she was
psychiatrically hospitalized and for the next twenty-some years. He was a
really creepy guy in Santa Barbara. He too became very prominent in
psychiatry. He was president of the [World Association of Social Psychiatry].
His name was John Carleton. I sat outside the waiting room when she had
appointments sometimes. As a teenager when I met him, he took my hand.
He wanted to show me around the offices, and he kind of fondled my hand
in a way that felt totally, totally creepy. I was a teenager who was already
afraid of inappropriate behavior by men. I wanted to get my hand away, and
he was fondling my hand so I was completely creeped out by this guy. I ran
into him at some APA meetings, one of which when I was a resident.
He got into an elevator and I was standing there with my residency
training director at Harvard, and [Carleton] turned to me and he said, “Well,
hi, Nanette. How nice to see you. Your mother told me to say hello.” My
mother was his patient. That is the most inappropriate thing in the world to
say. That is a total breach of confidentiality. I walk out of the elevator, and
my residency training director said, “Who is he?” I said, “My mother’s
psychiatrist.” I mean, totally embarrassing to me that that had happened. I’d
been doing [sex abuse] research. I was already out here. My mother called me
a few years after I [moved to San Francisco]. It actually was in the early
1990s. I was working on a big fundraiser for our lesbian health services here
115

in San Francisco, and I had created an idea of a fundraiser that was really
successful.
I was driving back across the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a time
when we had a car phone, and she called me. I said, “I really can’t talk right
now. I’m on the bridge.” She said, “I have something I have to tell you. I
know you’ve been doing all this work all this time [meaning, on sexual abuse]
and I know that you never liked Dr. Carleton.” She wanted to tell me--she
felt like she had to tell me--that she had been sexually involved with him and
when she told him that the relationship needed to stop, he had raped her.
She also said, “He also encouraged me to kill your father.” I was just
horrified at all this. “He encouraged me when we went out sailing to push
him overboard. That was before he raped me, before I told him I can’t keep
seeing him.”
[00:49:42] I contacted the California Licensing Board. He had
meanwhile married a patient. I don’t know how many patients he--I think
there were stories of multiple patients--I don’t know how many he married,
but he married at least one. The only thing I could think of to do was to
contact, again, the California Licensing Board, and I sent them this
complaint. I asked my mother if she’d be willing to be named on the
complaint. I don’t remember the circumstances exactly. She had gone
through this complicated decision-making process but I said to them,
“You’ve got to open a file on him. If you get any other complaints, you really
need to do something about it.”

116

The third story led to my resignation publicly from the American
Psychiatric Association in 1989, during the time that all these women
psychiatrists and mental health professionals were providing reparative,
supportive therapy to victims of abuse by male typically psychiatrists and
other physicians. The APA’s malpractice carrier was beginning to realize that
they were going to be losing tons of money on these claims. This is before
we started our work in this area. They were paying claims based on sexual
abuse. Now you can’t get any kind of insurance--malpractice coverage--that
would cover your sexually abusing a patient. Then they were paying.
One of the things that was really a problem for them is that
subsequent treating psychiatrists were helping these patients file complaints,
which means that the claims were continuing to rise and they were
continuing to lose money. They started going after these subsequent treating
psychiatrists with character assassination. One of those cases involved this
phenomenally strong woman psychiatrist in Colorado whose name is Martha
Gay. She was treating a patient who had been sexually abused by a
psychiatrist. The establishment came after Martha Gay to character
assassinate her and further character assassinate the patient who had filed a
claim against her abusing [male] psychiatrist. It was an appalling situation. I
went all in in support of Dr. Gay, and I publicly resigned from the APA over
the [attempt to malign her character]. That story ended up being a
FRONTLINE documentary.
I talked about that resignation in the FRONTLINE documentary.
Those are just some examples, [and that episode illustrated how one] moved
117

into very dangerous territory [when] working with individuals who were
seeking restitution from abuse.
Marine-Street: What was the response to the FRONTLINE documentary?
Gartrell: [00:53:28] Personally, for my part, I got a lot of positive feedback from
people who said how brave I was to take on the APA and to speak out
against the APA. The APA accepted my resignation like that [snaps fingers].
Things are different now, but these were very bad times then.
Marine-Street: Let’s take a real quick break.

PART:

5 OF 5

Marine-Street: Around 1986, you begin a new line of research. I wonder if you could tell us
the origin of the idea for the National Lesbian Family Study.
Gartrell: [00:00:15] Yes. Well, I had continued to do research and writing and teaching
and curriculum development related to lesbian and gay patients and nonhomophobic treatment of lesbian and gay people. In 1982 I also had a
clinical practice where I saw mostly closeted lesbians and some gay men.
What I heard a lot about in my practice from younger lesbians--up until their
forties, really--was a great desire to have children, but not having really the
means or the resources to do that. Some were thinking creatively about
getting pregnant using the sperm of a brother-in-law if the brother-in-law
was willing--meaning their lover’s brother. But that wasn’t always an easy
path. There was a lot of conversation about that.
In 1982, a sperm bank in the Bay Area opened its doors to single
heterosexual women and lesbians who [wanted] to become pregnant.
Suddenly, frozen sperm was being shipped all over the country to lesbians
119

who were desperate for the opportunity to give birth to biological children
and who had the means to pay for the sperm and the frozen vials and the
postage. I was starting to hear about this in my practice and in the
community, and there were meetings that were happening, planning
parenting meetings in the community. This was a new form of organizing
and information sharing, learning about parenting, happening in the Boston
community. I was in DC with a colleague, Jean Hamilton, having coffee near
Dupont Circle at Kramer’s bookstore, and we were talking about this new
social phenomenon that was happening in real time. And the conversation
led to, “We have to study it. We have to get going.”
Indeed, we decided that we would make it a national study. We could
start in Boston where I was, DC where she was, and I knew I was eventually
going to be moving to the Bay Area so also we would pick up a cohort in San
Francisco. We started putting out announcements--fliers. Again, this was
when computers were just starting but [we did not have] an internet. We
were not [living in the] internet age. How did we [spread the word]? The
same way we always did. We put up fliers. We handed out fliers. And we put
them up in women’s bookstores. We put them up at women’s concerts--the
same concerts that started in the 1970s were still happening. New
generations of musicians and much more diversity in the musicians, both in
terms of the kinds of music they performed and racially, ethnically and so on,
which was wonderful.
[00:03:32] We were handing out fliers and going to the parenting
support or planning groups and handing out fliers, inviting anybody who
120

[might be willing to commit to participating in a] twenty-year longitudinal
study of planned lesbian families. They needed to identify as lesbian, there
was no funding involved--never was [substantial] funding--but [we told them]
that we were interested in understanding [more] about the development of
these families and the psychological adjustment of children and the kinds of
experiences the families had around homophobia and stigmatization and just
pretty much anything. Those were the core issues that we presented to them.
Anybody who was interested [was encouraged to] call me or call her and
[sign up]. Then we recruited a small group of people as research
collaborators who were also mental health professionals, and we got started-printed the questionnaires, put the clipboards together.
Our residential requirement was that they had to live within 200 miles
of wherever the researchers lived because we had to put gas in the car, drive
to their homes, conduct the interviews, use a tape recorder, pencil, paper and
record the interviews and get home in one day--so thus the 200-mile limit.
We began gathering families. The moms needed to be inseminating or
pregnant. We began in 1986. I moved out here in 1987, and began recruiting
again in 1988 out here, and we continued recruiting until 1992 when we
closed the study to new participants. Our index offspring cover a five-year
age span because not everybody got pregnant at the same moment, and we
were also still recruiting until 1992.
The study is now in its thirty-second year, and we have a 92 percent
retention rate, which is unheard of for studies of this length. Our most recent
sixth wave of data gathering took place when the index offspring were
121

twenty-five years old. We gathered data when the moms were inseminating
or pregnant, when their kids were a year and a half or two years old, when
they were five, ten, seventeen, and twenty-five. The study’s ongoing. We had
no idea whether, as adults, these offspring would have an interest in this
study because some of the ages we chose because we thought maybe a little
parental influence might help in getting the surveys completed--as in before
they went to college as opposed to when they were in college.
[00:06:42] We thought by the time they’re adults, they might think,
“Oh my God--[I’m done with that].” We gathered data from them from the
time that they were ten years old and surveyed them--the offspring and the
mothers--all along, but we thought they might think, “I’m done with that.
That was a thing that my parents wanted me to do.” To our great surprise,
they [continue to] have great enthusiasm for the study. Last summer after we
had nearly completed our twenty-five-year-old data gathering, I sent out an
email to every single participant and said, “Okay, we’re now in our thirtysecond or thirty-first year, and some of you may be ready to retire from the
study.”
I said I’m sixty-eight years old. We’re thinking about the possibility of
doing another one in maybe five years or so, all of you at the same time, not
trying to age match it at that point. If you’d like to retire, if you feel that
you’re really [finished with completing surveys], we would like to know
because we don’t want you to feel obligated if that’s part of the feeling that
contributes to our wonderful response rate. We got back this overwhelming
enthusiasm. “Please keep going. We’ll go as long as you can. This is so
122

important. This is really, really valuable.” I suspect that the political climate
of what had already happened in the last election may have had some impact
on some of the enthusiasm. I think other parts of the enthusiasm are just
what they are. I mean what they said is they’re really incredibly proud to be
part of this effort that I have had such a commitment to following through
on, and they’re really proud to be part of that.
Marine-Street: As you think back over those thirty-two years, what were the biggest
obstacles or biggest worries that you had about the study?
Gartrell: [00:09:06] The biggest worry was losing contact with people because the last
thing they’re thinking of when they’re moving from here to there--and they
have moved from here to there--is, “Oh, send Nanette a postcard saying
here’s our change of address.” At the very beginning we asked them to give
us the names and addresses of people who would always know where they
were. But, of course, those people moved too. It took us some time to figure
out how frequently we needed to contact them to make sure we had their
updated contact information. It’s better since we’ve entered the internet era
because we can reach people more easily and more rapidly.
However, we’ve learned [from] the last two interviews of the
offspring [that at first] they were more tuned in to email, but now it’s all
about texts. I don’t know of a way to send out a mass text that’s confidential.
There are seventy-eight of them, and I have to literally send out a
personalized, individualized text to seventy-eight offspring each time I need
to communicate with them about an upcoming survey. What was easier to do
in a bcc kind of way, I can’t do anymore. Maybe, at some point, we’ll have
123

some way that I can do that more efficiently. Anyway, things like that-maintaining contact and also [having participants who] are dying [or have
died].
We’ve had a number of parental deaths, and we also lost one of our
offspring to a very tragic death. That’s sad. I don’t have children myself, but I
feel like this is my baby in a way. I mean, I’m the principal who’s carried it
forward all these years and have a fabulous, fabulous, fabulous collaborator,
Dr. Henny Bos [Henny M. W. Bos], who’s at the University of Amsterdam,
an endowed chair and professor there and a collaborator on this wave and
hopefully all future waves. Dr. Audrey Koh [Audrey S. Koh], who’s an
OB/GYN here in San Francisco who’s also a lesbian--both are lesbians and
she’s also a parent of two emerging adult sons so she brings the fresh
perspective of actual parenting experiences to our research, which is always
very valuable. [laughter]
Marine-Street: When you think back, as you were collecting the data and analyzing, can you
think of any sort of ah-ha moments when you saw something kind of coming
together?
Gartrell: [00:12:13] Interviewing the children at the age of ten about their experiences
with homophobia was a tremendous ah-ha moment for us because of what
we heard and the way they used language and the responses to our questions.
It’s common when you’re a member of a non-majority group for your
parents to prepare you for the kind of stigmatization that comes with being a
member of that group. But I don’t have any way of knowing--I haven’t done
research--on whether non-majority group members’ parents generally teach
124

them about discrimination against all non-majority groups. I suspect that
that’s not the case because we certainly know people who are members of
non-majority groups who have very homophobic parents who passed their
homophobia onto them.
What we heard from these children at ten was that they were likening
their experience of homophobic stigmatization to the kinds of experiences
that their classmates who were of a different race or ethnicity were
experiencing around discrimination based on their non-majority status. They
had this very sophisticated understanding of those concepts that they were
sharing with us in these interviews at the age of ten. That was so both
enlightening and exciting to us because so much of the conflict that we
experience in this world is based on a fear of difference. Not only did we
already know that the mothers were participating in the development of the
anti-bullying programs and the appreciation of difference programs in the
schools, but in this education of their children and preparing their children
for the prospect of stigmatization, they were not only teaching them about
their group. They were teaching them about discrimination based on looks
and size and race and ethnicity and gender. I mean, just across the board. If
all parents could do that, what a different world we would live in.
I would say the other ah-ha moment came when I was surveying the
seventeen-year-olds. We asked them if they considered their parents role
models and, if so, to describe why they did. 93 percent of them said yes, they
considered their mothers excellent role models. I’ve been a teenager and I
know many teenagers, and that was quite shocking to me. And then what
125

they said about their mothers. They wrote three or four sentences. [00:15:29]
They could write as much as they wanted but most wrote about three or four
sentences. “My mothers are beautiful, powerful, loving women who have
taught me respect and appreciation of all people. I would do anything to
become like them some day. I hope I’m like them some day.”
Comment after comment like that. It gives me goose bumps to
repeat them now. It did at that time. I was in tears reading them. They’re just
phenomenal. The relationships that these parents have with their children-these are first generation kids conceived through donor insemination in the
United States so they represent the first generation. And these are first
generation moms. The level of involvement that these parents had in the
education and growth and development of their children and the closeness of
their relationships and managing, out of all of that, for their seventeen-yearolds to consider them role models when most seventeen-year-olds don’t
consider anybody over the age of maybe nineteen a role model was really
amazing.
Marine-Street: I’m so glad you did that study. We’re getting towards the end of our
interview, but I wanted to give you a chance to talk about any other more
recent books or publications. I know you have quite a few things that you’ve
been involved with. Is there anything in particular you’d like to be a part of
this oral history?
Gartrell: [00:17:07] I’ll just conclude with our most recent effort. Immediately after the
last what we thought was a presidential election, Dee--my spouse--and our
friend and colleague, Judith Herman, and I wrote a letter to President Obama
126

expressing our concern about the mental instability of the person who was
going to be occupying the White House [and stating that he needed a
thorough neuropsychiatric examination]. The letter went nowhere, but
eventually through an inquiry from somebody who we know who writes for
a prominent mainstream newspaper, the letter was given to somebody at the
Huffington Post who published it and it went viral. All of a sudden, this whole
concept of his mental instability was being written about in front page stories
all over the world.
Our neighbors happened to be in a major city in India, and it was a
front page story there. I mean, it was everywhere. Subsequently, Gloria
Steinem and Robin Morgan saw the Huffington Post article and became
involved in having conversations with us about where to go from there.
Robin Morgan reminded us--for those who don’t maybe know who Robin
Morgan is, she’s one of my sheroes, along with Gloria Steinem. She runs
Women’s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan. She also is a former editor
of Ms. She’s [been] a feminist [forever, and also poet, writer, radio and media
host]. She wrote Sisterhood is Global, and Sisterhood is Powerful. We carried dogeared copies of her book whenever we traveled internationally in the 1980s.
She’s just amazing. She reminded us of the time during the Nixon
Administration when he was about to be escorted out of office that there
was a great fear that he would start a nuclear war and Schlesinger [James R.
Schlesinger] and Kissinger [Henry Kissinger] made an agreement that they
would do whatever they could to prevent that--in conjunction with
conversations with the Pentagon.
127

[Robin and Gloria] said to us, “We need to do something to
communicate with people at the Pentagon”--[laughter] what a concept--at
Stanford, the Pentagon was the “military industrial complex” when I was an
undergraduate--“to inform them of our expert opinion that he needs a
neuropsychiatric evaluation.” We never have diagnosed. We have said he
needs a neuropsychiatric evaluation and gave all these reasons. As it turned
out, Dee and I knew somebody who was a high ranking military official and
that person was able to take our letter, a letter addressed to the Chair of the
Joints Chiefs of Staff, and get it to [him]. We actually had the [letter]
communicated directly to General Dunford [Joseph Francis Dunford Jr.].
[00:21:12] Also through another just amazing coincidence, I met
somebody who had just come from a stint at working at Langley and I said,
“Langley, I mean, as in the CIA?” She said, “Yes.” I said, “Any chance you’d
be willing to [convey] a letter? Do you have allies there who are concerned
about the same things we’re concerned with?” “Yes, yes, yes, I do,” she says.
So she conveyed our letter to allies at Langley--her allies. Subsequently, other
people were starting to raise the same concern. One of them was Dr. Bandy
Lee at Yale who’s an expert on violence. She put together a conference on
this topic. That led to a book to which we became contributors. She’s the
editor, and she’s become the spokesperson for our movement urging a
neuropsychiatric evaluation for him.
The book is called, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists
and Others Assess a President. Dee and I have the final chapter in the book; [we
discuss using] the 25th Amendment [to] empanel a group of physician
128

experts, appointed in a non-partisan way by the National Academy of
Medicine, to evaluate the president. Our chapter precedes Noam Chomsky’s
epilogue, which [focuses on] the end of the species and the doomsday clock.
So that’s our most recent major political effort.
Marine-Street: Do you think anything will come of it?
Gartrell: [00:23:06] I think a lot has come of it. The book became an instant best
seller, both on Amazon and the New York Times best seller list. It’s been
talked about endlessly, and routinely references are made to his mental
instability by people across the board throughout the media. I think that the
[movement we started] has educated those who are able to be educated about
this topic.
Marine-Street: Alright. Do you have any final parting thoughts as we conclude this interview
today?
Gartrell: [00:23:53] I guess I would say that my entire career has been one in which the
personal is the political. Even most recently, the great fear that a person who
demonstrates signs of mental instability has access to the nuclear codes made
it very clear that there was great urgency to try to protect the planet. But long
before that, my goals were to make this world a better and safer place and
provide civil rights for LGBT people. That has been a mission throughout
my career and will continue to be. [My sex abuse work became a parallel
track]--also more than a decade’s worth of work--because I just happened to
fall into some knowledge about [physician] abuse of patients and power
abuse. That [line of work] became a very big theme in my life. And it recurs
now as we’re in the #MeToo movement. [All around us] we see the
129

incredibly positive changes that are occurring as women are speaking out
about abuse.
My interview began with your questions about my experiences of
abuse as a child. At one point you asked how did I get through those
experiences and manage to keep on going. I have to say that I don’t think
anybody who has gone through abuse could probably answer the question of
why we made it to the next step other than at first, we’re [just] trying to
survive. And then [of course it’s incredibly fortunate] if we can garner
resources, [perhaps] have the privilege and the good fortune of having
something like a Stanford education with access to really smart and talented
people, and [then take a] look around at movement activists who have the
strength and [talent to] create communities to make changes and work for
social justice. I’ve had the privilege of knowing amazing community activists
who have created phenomenal change and [forged] paths to so much social
justice in our world. I have simply been trying to do my part in the
dimensions that are within my area of expertise.
Marine-Street: Thank you for sharing this story with us, and thank you for your courage.
Gartrell: [00:26:47] Thank you.
