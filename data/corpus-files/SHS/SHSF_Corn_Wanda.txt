Introduction
This interview was carried out by the Stanford Oral History Program, sponsored by the
Stanford Historical Society and the Stanford University Archives. The Stanford Oral History
Program is under the direction of the Oral History Committee of the Stanford Historical
Society. The interview was conducted in 2011 by Betsy Fryberger, the Burton and DeeDee
McMurtry Curator of Prints and Drawings, Emerita, Stanford University. The transcript and
recording are part of a collection of oral history interviews documenting the history of the
University and the experiences, accomplishments, problems, and viewpoints of members of
the Stanford community.
The transcript was lightly edited by program staff and by Wanda M. Corn to correct
grammar and occasional inaccuracies and to aid in overall readability, while maintaining the
interviewee’s voice as well as the transcript’s content. As a result of this process, the
transcript may not match the recording verbatim. The interview itself is an authentic account
of the remembered past, but as memory and meaning vary from person to person, we
cannot guarantee there will not be errors or discrepancies.
All uses of the interview transcript are covered by a legal agreement between Wanda M.
Corn and the Stanford Oral History Program. The transcript is thereby made available for

Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program
Purpose Statement
The Stanford Historical Society's Oral History Program explores the institutional history of
the University, with an emphasis on the transformative post-WWII period, through
interviews with leading faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and others. The project furthers the
Society's mission "to foster and support the documentation, study, publication, and
preservation of the history of the Leland Stanford Junior University."
The interview recordings and transcripts provide valuable additions to the existing collection
of written and photographic materials in the Stanford University Archives. In addition to
scholarly use, information from these interviews may be shared more broadly through print
articles, campus lectures, or electronic media.
Like any primary source material, oral history is not intended to present the final, verified, or
complete narrative of events. It is a unique, reflective, spoken account, offered by the
interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it may be deeply personal. By capturing
the flavor of incidents, events, and personalities, the oral history approach provides details
and viewpoints that are not often found in traditional records.

Abstract
Wanda M. Corn’s interview traces her education in art history and eventual conversion to
the emerging field of American art history in the 1960s. Corn discusses her experience of
working with Lorenz Eitner and Al Elsen, the evolution and growth of the Department of
Art and Art History, the relationship between the department and the Stanford museum, the
trends in art history education, the gratification and challenges in chairing the department,
the challenges facing the Stanford museum after the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, her
involvement in promoting the interests of woman faculty, her tenure as the third director of
the Stanford Humanities Center, the John Cage celebration and the experience of hosting
Spalding Gray, and the trips she led for Stanford Travel/Study. She concludes the interview
with her thoughts on the Stanford Initiative for Creativity in the Arts.

Wanda M. Corn
Biography
Having earned a BA (l963), MA (l965) and Ph.D. (l974) from New York University,
Professor Wanda Corn taught at Washington Square College, the University of California,
Berkeley, and Mills College before moving to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California in
1980. At Stanford she held the university's first permanent appointment in the history of
American art and served as chair of the Department of Art and Art History and Acting
Director of the Stanford Museum. From l992 to 1995 she was the Anthony P. Meier Family
Professor and Director of the Stanford Humanities Center. In 2000, she became the Robert
and Ruth Halperin Professor in Art History. She retired from teaching at Stanford in 2008.
In 2009, she was the John Rewald Distinguished Visiting Lecturer, at the CUNY Graduate
Center.
A scholar of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American art and photography,
Professor Corn has received fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies,
the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars, the Smithsonian Regents, the Stanford Humanities Center, the Radcliffe Institute
of Advanced Study, and the Clark Institute of Art. In 2006-07, she was the Samuel H. Kress
Professor at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the National Gallery of Art.
She has won numerous teaching awards: in 2007 The Distinguished Teaching of Art History
Award from the College Art Association; in 2002 the Phi Beta Kappa Undergraduate
Teaching Award; and in 1974 the Graves Award for outstanding teaching in the humanities.
In 2006, the Archives of American Art awarded her The Lawrence A. Fleischman Award for
Scholarly Excellence in the Field of American Art History and in 2007 she received the
Women's Caucus for Art Life Time Achievement Award in the Visual Arts. In 2003 she was
the Clark Distinguished Visiting Professor at Williams College. She has served two terms on
the Board of Directors of the College Art Association and two on the Commission for the
Smithsonian American Art Museum. She served on the Advisory Board of the Georgia
O’Keeffe Catalogue Raisonné, two terms on the Board of the Terra Foundation in American
Art, and is today a trustee of the Wyeth Foundation in American Art.

9

Active as a visiting curator, she had produced various books and exhibitions, including The

Color of Mood: American Tonalism 1990-1910 (1972); The Art of Andrew Wyeth (l973);
and Grant Wood: The Regionalist Vision (1983) and in 2011-12, Seeing Gertrude Stein,

Five Stories. Her historiographic article for Art Bulletin, "Coming of Age: Historical
Scholarship in American Art" (June l988), became a significant point of reference in the field
as has her work on cultural nationalism in early American modernism. Her study of avantgarde modernist culture along the Atlantic rim, The Great American Thing: Modern Art

and American Identity, 1915-35, was published by the University of California Press 1999.
UC Press has recently published Professor Corn’s Women Building History about Mary
Cassatt and the decorative program of murals and sculptures for the Woman’s Building at
the 1893 Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition. She continues to research, write, and
lecture on high, middle, and low culture interpretations of Grant Wood’s American Gothic.

WANDA M. CORN

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MAY 1, 2011

Fryberger: Let me begin by introducing myself. I’m Betsy Fryberger. I was Curator of
Prints & Drawings at the Stanford Museum and later at the Cantor Arts
Center, in all for some forty years. I’m interviewing Wanda Corn about her
Stanford years. I knew Wanda at various stages of her time at Stanford and
so I’ll be interspersing a few of my memories. Now, Wanda has already
spoken about her long and distinguished career a few days ago to Stanford
Emeriti Council members. And her lecture, I believe, is going to be available
on Stanford on iTunes U as are lectures by some of the other emeritus faculty.
So Wanda, of course I Googled you and I checked out traditional sources
and so on, but in this interview, I’m going to focus on your Stanford career.
And the many other aspects of your career that are significant, I’m afraid, will
only be lightly touched on or even omitted, like your marvelous book. In
your Stanford years, the first thing I want to cover is your sense of coming to
a larger university at a rather traumatic time and as acting director of the
museum after another traumatic event, the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake.
Then I want to talk about your time at the Humanities Center and more
generally some questions about women on the faculty and your own graduate

11

students, and finally, several projects that you probably knew about, which
finally are getting to the point of being implemented, SiCa and the relocation
of the art building next to the museum. But first, why don’t you tell us a little
bit about your New England upbringing and I hope you don’t mind
repeating this. It really does set the stage for how you as an East Coast
person became interested in art history...medieval art history and then how
discovering some family paintings changed your whole perspective.
Corn: [00:01:49] I was born in Connecticut -- Wethersfield, Connecticut, south of
Hartford. My parents were mid-westerners, my father from a farm in
Indiana and my mother from a small town, Covington, in Ohio. My father
had left his farm roots, become a math teacher after his college education...he
was the first and only member of his family to go to college and then decided
he wanted to go into the ministry. He went to theological school for his
divinity degree at Garrett Theological Seminary and then went to Yale
University for his PhD. That’s how it was that I grew up as a New
Englander as opposed to a mid-westerner. My father became a
Congregational minister first in Hamden, Connecticut, where I was born, and
then, in 1943, he became the senior minister of the Congregational Church in
Wethersfield, Connecticut.
[00:02:42] He was there all his working adult life and I lived in a parsonage -two different parsonages in fact, the second of which was right next door to
the church. When I was twelve, my father helped the church buy a large 1832
neo-Georgian home that was right next door to the church. And the reason
this is important and not just a little personal detail is that my father saw to it

12

that this house was restored to its 1832 appearance. I should say my parents,
because my mother was deeply involved in this renovation as well. They
went to a local antique dealer, Mrs. Betty Thornberg, who got very involved
in the project and saw to it that the house was furnished in all its public
rooms and in many of the bedrooms with period piece furniture from the
early nineteenth century, including a couple of portraits of a man and woman
that were restored.
[00:03:53] We don’t know who the sitters are, but these portrait paintings had
been found in the attic of the new parsonage and were restored and put in
the library and dining room of the house. The house was historic enough to
be on a spring tour and was often open to the public for other events. Well
okay, that house becomes an important experience but I certainly didn’t
know it at the time. I went on to college, Bates College, for two years, and
then I got the bug to go abroad and study in London for a year. I decided in
London that art history was my thing. I was head over heels in love with my
new field. I had studied with people I now know to be great names but, for
me at the time, they were just the art historians at hand. I took yearlong
courses with L.D. Ettlinger and Francis Haskell at the Slade School and
Nikolaus Pevsner at Birkbeck College. Both of these colleges are part of the
University of London. And I also went to the Courtauld for lectures and
courses where people like Ernst Gombrich, Anthony Blunt, and Peter and
Linda Murray were teaching.
[00:05:03] So I had an illustrious beginning to art history, although basically I
couldn’t take much advantage of all this expertise, because I was a beginning

13

student plowing my way through my first survey text, The Story of Art by
Gombrich at the time, trying to figure out how art historians did their work.
And I went off with Pevsner and other students to study medieval cathedrals
on two different field trips and our job was to figure out when one building
phase had ended and a next had started. So I got very immersed in the
medieval world and fascinated by the ways in which these cathedrals would
take three hundred years to build and complete. I stayed a second year in
Europe, going to Paris where I earned my keep as a jeune fille au pair and took
courses at the Sorbonne. After that I went to Washington Square College at
NYU, majoring in the art history program there.
My teachers in London were mostly German and Jewish who left Germany
because of World War II. [00:06:05] Art history in Germany took a terrible
hit with the loss of its Jewish art historians during the Nazi regime. When I
asked my English tutors where I should go to finish my art history
undergraduate degree -- Bates College did not offer any art history -- they
recommended NYU and the University of Chicago where other émigrés
were teaching. I applied to both schools for what I hoped would be my final
BA year. Chicago accepted me but said it would take me two more years to
complete its BA program. They told me that I had to do two years with
them because they had their great books program and all their students had
to fulfill a certain number of required courses. But at NYU, the department
of art history was chaired by H. W. Janson whom we called Peter Janson.
[00:06:56] Peter Janson, seeing my letters from his London colleagues,
especially Ettlinger’s and Pevsner’s, took me in and said he’d work out the

14

credit in such a way that I could transfer three years of college credit into the
NYU undergraduate degree program. He put together my course work from
England that I had followed with a year of study in France to learn the
language better. I knew I’d need French to do any advanced work in art
history. Peter Janson cobbled all my European courses altogether and let me
finish at Washington Square College within a year. And then I went on to
take my MA and my PhD at the Institute of Fine Arts, which is the graduate
program in art history at New York University. In any case, it’s kind of
another nice story about this German networking, because when I asked
Peter Janson where I should go for my MA, he said, well there’s only two
places to go, our school, that is the Institute of Fine Arts and the University
of California, Berkeley, where my good friend Walter Horn teaches and he is
a great medievalist.
[00:08:06] I didn’t realize it at the time but every summer, Peter Janson went
to Berkeley to teach a summer course and also hang out with and go
mushroom picking with his good friend, Walter Horn. So I applied to and
was accepted by those two schools. At the time, I knew nothing about
Berkeley whatsoever. And I got married in 1963, the same year I graduated
from NYU’s BA program and I needed to work things out with Joe Corn,
my new husband, as to where I should study. He became interested in
teaching in a private school on the Hudson, Scarborough School, so I chose
to go to the Institute of Fine Arts over Berkeley. Little did I know, but my
path would have me come to the West Coast eventually, but not at that
particular juncture.

15

[00:09:02] I applied to the Institute of Fine Arts as a medievalist because I
was still under the spell of the wonderful training I had had with Pevsner.
And I just applied for the MA degree. It never occurred to me at that time
that I might be so bold or courageous to take a PhD because basically I had
had no women professors who had ever done that and so it really was
inconceivable to me. I wanted to work in museums and the Institute of Fine
Arts had a MA art history degree and along with it, you could take something
called the museum certification program. It consisted of three courses in
museum history and connoisseurship, and included meeting and working
with museum curators through internships and the like. So I went to the
Institute as a medievalist. I didn’t know exactly how one would study
medieval art in the states, when all of the monuments were over there in
France and England. [00:10:02] But I knew it was a very popular field of
study, as were all the courses in European art at the Institute of Fine Arts at
that time. So I bumbled along, but did not enjoy the medieval courses I had
at the Institute in the same way that I had enjoyed them in England. And this
is where my family experience with the parsonage comes into play. While I
was in graduate school, and that was between ’63 and ’65 for the MA, my
parents opened the parsonage on a spring tour. This is the parsonage in
Wethersfield, the 1832 building that my parents had restored and that we
were then happily living in.
[00:10:50] I loved listening to the old bell of the 1780’s colonial church ring
every quarter of an hour for twenty-four hours around. My bedroom faced
the church so I heard that bell all the time, and I can get quite kind of teary-

16

eyed at just even thinking about it. In any case, on this spring open house
tour a professor from Amherst College -- Reginald French -- who was not an
art historian, but a teacher of romance languages, came through the house.
He had made a hobby out of tracking a Connecticut River itinerant portrait
artist, who at that point was not known to art history. The artist’s name was
Erastus Salisbury Field and when French saw these two portraits that my
family had of a man and a woman circa 1840–45 in the house, he asked my
father if he could take them out of doors. They were not signed and he
wanted to see them better in the daylight. So they were taken off the walls
and went out in the yard as the story goes.
[00:12:19] And French said I know who painted these and he told my father
about this itinerant artist. This man eventually pieced together Field’s life
and career, just as an art historian would. But art historians at that time were
not much involved with this kind of art that we now call folk or vernacular
or outsider art. In the fall of 1963, French organized the first retrospective
of Erastus Salisbury Field’s paintings for the Connecticut Historical Society
in Hartford and asked my parents to lend their paintings for his exhibition.
They did and of course I went to see it. I was knocked out by the fact that
the research behind the show used traditional art historical skills in figuring
out Field’s early, middle, mature and late style career.
[00:13:17] The exhibition included ephemeral pieces like clothing and chairs
that had come down with the portrait. Families had saved these pieces of
material culture because the chair was in the portrait or the clothing was on
the child. This Amherst professor had done a superb job in putting together

17

the unknown career of a significant American artist. At that point, historic
American art was not on my screen. I had never heard any lectures on the
history of American art and I hadn’t read any books about it. I really had a
kind of an epiphany seeing the Field exhibition, realizing that maybe this
country had its own history of art, just like that of France or England. I went
back to the libraries and I discovered that American folk art, at that time in
the 1960s, had a fifty year history of being discovered and collected by art
people who boasted of it as an authentic art form of democratic American
culture. Overnight I discarded my interest in medieval art and wrote my MA
thesis on the rediscovery of nineteenth-century American folk art in the early
twentieth century.
[00:14:29] I did it very quickly that I was going to learn more about how
someone like Erastus Salisbury Field worked and what kind of art he did and
how it was that in the twentieth century, the kind of art he made had become
popular and collectible. His art was unschooled in some ways although we
know that Field took a few classes under Samuel F.B. Morse in New York. I
wanted to know that story. So in 1965, I wrote an MA thesis that I called
“The Return of the Native: The Development of Interest in American
Primitive Painting.” That was the beginning of my interest in American art.
From that point on, I was hooked on learning the history of this culture’s art
and trying to figure out how I could do this kind of work in an academic
setting where there was no such field and no such major. But it became
possible at the Institute to sort of sneak it into the curriculum.

18

[00:15:34] You had to declare yourself a student of modern art, which at that
point was defined as the study of European art from the French Revolution
to the present, and you could make a side field if you wanted to in American
art, with the blessings of, in my case, Peter Janson, and my main advisor,
Robert Goldwater. (Colin Eisler who was in charge of the museum
certification program was another important teacher for me. And I audited
two courses by Meyer Shapiro at Columbia who was very influential on me
methodologically.) Also you had to have an affiliated minor and that meant
something outside your major. While most of my peers would take on
eighteenth century European art as their affiliated minor, I went downtown
to Washington Square and took my affiliated minor in American literature of
the nineteenth century. That introduced me to the world of what we today
called American studies, an interdisciplinary group of courses that
synthesized history, art, music, and literature. [00:16:42] These literature
courses were thrilling to me because no one else in my peer group of art
history students was paying so much attention to culture...the broader culture
in which the work of art grew. Today I sometimes think I’m as much a
cultural historian as I am an art historian and the roots of it were right there
in those graduate courses that I was taking in American literature at
Washington Square College. And I was allowed to bring one of those literary
profs onto my orals committee, so that I was examined in the broad field of
modern art with a minor in American art and another in American Literature.
[00:17:37] That’s the story of my conversion experience to American art. I
never took a formal course exclusively in historic American art. There never

19

was one. There may have been a course taught by Goldwater in modern
sculpture with some American sculptors in it and there was a Goldwater
course I believe on American contemporary art that began with a little bit of
Eakins, Homer, and I think Demuth and Sheeler, and the Ashcan School,
maybe three lectures or something of the like as a kind of prelude to art after
World War II.
Fryberger:

You know, it’s interesting, when I was an undergraduate at Bryn Mawr, there
was no course on American art as such, but certainly we covered some of the
main figures who were woven into the thread, but I think actually there was a
course on American architecture.

Corn: [00:18:28] Yes, American architecture was in the academy before American
painting and sculpture. The thing is that American painting and sculpture
were always sort of damned with faint praise and there was this deep down
prejudice that what our artists practiced was really warmed over
Europeanisms. American artists were not assumed to have their own cultural
or artistic or stylistic distinction and it was very hard to get over the barriers
of that kind of prejudice.
Fryberger: When you got your degree and then came west...tell us a little bit about that,
but then also when you were teaching at Mills, was it a more of a cultural art
history? What was the sort of focus of the Mills art history program? Did
you broaden it and change it when you arrived?
Corn: [00:19:24] Yes. So I came west because of my husband’s going into the PhD
American history program at Berkeley. And I was very lucky because in
Berkeley...well let me back up. In the Bay Area, there was an enthusiast and a

20

teacher of American art that I certainly want this interview to record and that
was Alfred Frankenstein. Alfred Frankenstein was a world unto himself. He
was the art critic of the San Francisco Chronicle when I arrived. But at
one point, he had been the music critic and then I think he migrated to art,
out of his own excitement about the history of American art. One thing to
remember about American art is it was being shown in our museums. It
wasn’t studied in our academies, but it had begun to have an important place
in museums since the 1920’s or so.
[00:20:34] You know museums had American period rooms and some had
independent American departments of painting and sculpture. It wasn’t as if
it was a totally dead field. In fact, it was lively in the museums and
Frankenstein liked reviewing museum and gallery exhibitions of American
art. Frankenstein had an undergraduate degree in humanities from the
University of Chicago. He had no higher degrees, about which he was very
quiet. I think he felt a little...
Fryberger: Defensive?
Corn: [00:21:10] He felt a little defensive about his lack of training and whether or
not he had adequate training to become the art historical voice that he
became. But what was important were a couple of things. One is that by the
time I arrived on the West Coast in 1969, he had raised the consciousness of
the Bay Area to the beauties and the richness of American art. He had laid
the groundwork and he had begun to teach American art, a two-term course
he had invented that was a basic survey of American art. He did it all, from
Copley to Jackson Pollock and he would give it...

21

Fryberger:

Where was he teaching?

Corn: [00:21:50] He was teaching at Mills College in Oakland and at UC Berkeley.
So this was my good fortune when I arrived and was struggling to make
some money. Joe had put me through school while he taught at
Scarborough, and I now had to put him through his PhD and make some
livelihood; we ran out of money pretty quickly after we arrived. I had some
fellowship money that was still owed me because I hadn’t yet finished the
PhD but it was to support a museum internship. I hadn’t yet written my
dissertation. And so immediately I began to pass my CV around and
Berkeley offered me a summer job, which was a blessing. I taught that first
summer that we were here, which would have been the summer of ’70. Then
my good fortune was Alfred Frankenstein’s misfortune, he slipped a disc.
[00:22:48] It was around Christmas time and I don’t know if it was the
Christmas of ’69 or the Christmas of ’70. I’m thinking it was the Christmas
of ’70. He slipped a disc and was bedridden and in traction, and he was in
the middle of teaching a yearlong course at Mills College where I was known
because my CV was circulating. I actually never had gone to Mills but
somebody at Mills knew about me from somebody at Berkeley. And I got
called and asked if I could pick up Frankenstein’s course in like two weeks'
time. I was thrilled to have this unexpected opportunity and I had to call
home and have my father dredge through some old notes and send me some
books. Anyway, I had to really hop to it to make this course happen.
[00:23:45] And of course, what was really a problem is that there was no slide
collection at Mills College. And Alfred had, over the years, put together his

22

own magnificent slide collection of American art. So he said, feeling terrible
that he was having to renege on his courses, that I could come over and
borrow any slides I wanted from him. So that’s how I met Alfred
Frankenstein. I met him in bed, with his legs up in the air and I’m sure I
looked like a little twerp to him. I was just hitting my thirtieth birthday. And
I can’t do Alfred’s arithmetic, but I’m sure he was very close to sixty-five. I
think you had to retire at seventy back then and eventually he had to retire
from Mills and he had to retire from Berkeley because of state or federal
laws.
[00:24:41] So that’s how I met Alfred and he pointed me to this little closet
of his, which was filled with boxes of slides, just with artist’s names on them,
Homer, Eakins, Ryder and so on and he let me fill up my basket with all the
slides I needed for the course. And I took them home and was able to teach
my first course in American art. I taught that same course as a substitute for
Alfred at some point at Berkeley as well.
Mills College had two and a half art historians at that point. The main figure
was Alfred Neumeyer. Alfred Neumeyer was another important German art
historian who had left home in the 1930s...Germans were all over my training
and...
Fryberger: They dominated...
Corn: [00:25:31] They dominated the field. And also I can’t tell you how many
fantastic German art historians created the Bay Area’s art history programs.
We’ve already mentioned Walter Horn, but there was also Neumeyer at Mills
and there was also Eugen Neuhaus, who started I think, and certainly chaired

23

the art and art history department at Berkeley. He wrote a history of
American art that I had read in preparation for my orals and he was an
amazing man. I never knew him, but I came to know his son, Robert
Neuhaus who wrote a book on Frank Duveneck. Robert had gone back to
Germany to do his PhD in Munich I believe and did his thesis on Duveneck.
[00:26:28] By the time I came to the Bay Area, he had long been out of art
history. He needed to make a living and he was doing something completely
different but he always had a dream of publishing his study. And I helped
make that possible by finding him a publisher at some point later on and to
this day, one of my best friends is Cynthia Neuhaus, the granddaughter of
Eugen.
[00:27:01] Anyway Alfred Neumeyer was a modernist. He taught basically
from the Renaissance to the present in the survey course and then he taught
the courses in modern European art. And Mills had a wonderful reputation
because all through the forties and into the fifties, especially during the war, it
had had a living artists’ program in the summer. And so Max Beckmann had
come through and Fernand Léger was there and did a series of images of the
Mills College swimming pool. The Budapest Quartet had come for several
summers running. Darius Milhaud had been on the Mills faculty and I met
his widow on occasion. His music was often played in the Bay Area. There
was a real sense of connective tissue between Mills and the European
modernists that had come through. Those summer programs were all over
when I arrived. But their spirit lingered on.

24

[00:27:52] And so many people talked about these visitors. So I felt like I
was in a place that had really been a part of the making of
modernism...European modernism, which was really special. Well another
piece of good fortune was that Alfred Neumeyer was also forced to retire,
whether it was sixty-five or seventy I can’t remember, but I think it was
seventy, and suddenly a permanent teaching position opened up at Mills
College. I had been there part time for maybe two years, three years...while I
was also doing exhibitions at the same time at the de Young.
[00:28:28] So I was plenty busy enough. But when he retired, I just slipped,
almost naturally into his position. There was no such thing as national
searches in those days. It was all an old boys’ network. In this case, it was an
old boy network that this girl infiltrated, and I got a fulltime tenure line job
and eventually won my tenure at Mills a few years later. Neumeyer also was
very interested in American art. Alfred did the Mills course in American art,
but Neumeyer was writing a history of American art for Germans. He was
writing in German.
[00:29:15] So he took great advantage of me, I mean good advantage of me
because he pumped me for bibliography. He asked me to read things he had
written. He wanted help with me on dates and attribution. You know it was
really quite nice, a senior guy like this, looking to me for help. I felt like a
youngster at that point. I was very touched that I could actually help
somebody that I knew was a very admired and productive scholar. Anyway,
when I took over Neumeyer’s job, I was also taking over for Alfred because
Alfred also had to resign because of the law. But of course, Stanford

25

University, this is also part of the Stanford story, did not have to obey
whatever retirement rules there were. There were no retirement rules of
quite the same nature.
[00:30:16] Anyway, so guess what...when Alfred Frankenstein lost his
positions... one annual course at each school... somehow the word reached
Lorenz Eitner who hired him for...do you know how many years? It must
have been for three, four, maybe five years and Alfred would do the very
same course with the very same slides at Stanford.
Fryberger: I want to take a break before we get into Stanford, but Frankenstein had a
red convertible right? And so he would drive down from the city in his red
convertible, I listened to some of his classes. Do you think that Frankenstein
contributed slides to the Stanford slide collection?
Corn: [00:31:01] I know he did. He gave all his slides to Stanford. By the end of his
life he was irked at Mills and Berkley. He was not ready to bow out. I think
by all rights he probably should have given them the slides, but he was very
happy with his reception at Stanford. He was very happy that they still
wanted an aging scholar and he, in the meantime, had written a fantastic
book of course on Harnett and the Trompe L'oeil School in the nineteenth
century (After the Hunt). I think he promised Lorenz that he would give
Stanford all his slides, which was a major resource.
Fryberger: And I think he gave a lot of books to the...
Corn: [00:31:43] And I think he gave books as well. But I know about the slides
because I had my graduate students catalogue them so we could integrate
them into the Stanford collection and I wouldn’t have to always be hunting

26

through Frankenstein’s funny little cardboard boxes. And that’s the
foundation of our slide collection of American art at Stanford.
Fryberger: That’s great.
[Interview paused.]
[Interview resumed.]
Fryberger: So we took a little break, but we’re back and now we’re going to talk about
when Wanda first came to Stanford and I’m asking her to talk a little bit at
length about Lorenz Eitner who had arrived in 1963 and who entirely
reshaped the department, added a graduate program and brought the long
neglected museum to life. Now that’s a whole story in itself, but anyway I
was at the museum for many years so I know something about that. But
Lorenz hired not only art historians Al Elsen and Dwight Miller, but also
studio artists Frank Lobdell, Nathan Oliveira, and later integrated
photography into the department with the appointment of Leo Holub.
Lobdell, Oliveira, and Holub have already been interviewed for the Stanford
Historical Society’s records, but unfortunately neither Lorenz Eitner nor Al
Elsen was. So I welcome your reminiscences about each of them and what
they contributed both in teaching and to the museum, knowing of your
interest in both the academy and the museum.
Corn: [00:33:16] I was hired in the spring of 1980 and began teaching the academic
year 1980-81. It was one of the most exciting days of my life when Al Elsen
called. I was in Washington DC on a Wilson Center fellowship with Joe,
who was on another fellowship at the Smithsonian. And Al Elsen, not
Lorenz, called to ask me if I would consider a teaching position at Stanford.

27

Fryberger: Did you know Al? Had you met him?
Corn: [00:33:58] I had met Al and I was known a little bit to the museum friends.
What did we call them? The museum...
Fryberger: The Committee for...
Corn: [00:34:08] The Committee for Art.
Fryberger: And you had done this exhibition on tonalism.
Corn: [00:34:12] And I had done three exhibitions actually, American Tonalism in
1972 and Andrew Wyeth in 1973 and the American Collection of Mr. and
Mrs. John D. Rockefeller III in 1976. And the Committee for Art, I believe
it was, on at least two occasions, had issued me invitations to speak. I know
they had for Wyeth and I think they also did for Rockefeller. I don’t believe
I was known enough to have been invited to talk about tonalism. But for
Wyeth and Rockefeller, I think I gave public lectures at Stanford while I was
teaching at Mills. I taught at Mills for ten years from 1970 to 1980. I also
had been invited by the Committee for Art to teach, I think perhaps, a series
of lectures of my own choosing.
[00:34:56] I can’t remember exactly but they asked me to do a lecture series
and I think the Committee for Art was kind of famous for that. They would
do like four lectures over the course of a month and a half, something like
that, right? They’d use the Annenberg Auditorium and it was always
practically full. Those days have come and gone. Even a stranger from across
the Bay like me could fill the hall.
Fryberger: Then, there was an enormous attendance at public lectures.

28

Corn: [00:35:23] I’m right, the invitation was from the Committee for Art or maybe
it was Lorenz’ office that was issuing it, but I believe it was sponsored by the
museum and I always got an honorarium of some sort, but also I was
flattered. I was just very flattered that Stanford would want me, the young
art historian here, to come in and talk, and it was always about American art.
I was recognized for my passion for the history of American art. So that was
one early link to Stanford that I had. And then the other link was Al Elsen
because Al was president of the College Art Association. I was also, during
the seventies, a board member of the College Art Association. The College
Art Association was under terrific pressure in the seventies -- starting in the
sixties -- to diversify its board.
[00:36:21] Its board was almost entirely made up of male art historians of a
certain maturity, all from northeast institutions. And here’s where Peter
Jansen played another role in my good fortune. When he was President of
the CAA board, he asked me to replace somebody who had left the board.
As I like to always tell the story, by appointing me, he got a woman, he got
youth, and he got West Coast, none of which were well represented on the
board at that time. Well that was a heady experience for me to go onto this
very prestigious board of the College Art Association and one person on that
board was Al Elsen. So Al and I came to meet through CAA meetings. And
also Al was the chair of an ethics committee of the College Art Association
and he asked me to be a member of that committee.
[00:37:25] So, a couple of times I came across the bay to Stanford and had
committee meetings with him and began to realize how important, for

29

instance, the sculpture collection was that he was building then. And I knew
of Al because I had had to study all his Rodin scholarship to get ready for my
PhD orals. He was Mr. Rodin of course. He had done all the modern
scholarship on Rodin that seemed to matter at that time. So I was very
touched that Al would be interested in my participation on the ethics
committee. Those were the days where Kirk Varnedoe was in the Stanford
PhD program. And I remember once, coming to Stanford, and Kirk had his
feet up on Al’s desk, you know, very professorial, and I believe he was
replacing Al and teaching for him at that particular moment.
[00:38:16] In any case, when this phone call came, Joe and I were on these
fellowships in Washington DC and we weren’t sure we were going to come
back west. I still had my appointment at Mills but Joe was now finished with
his PhD and he was ready to get a job and we were fishing for positions in
the East. We always thought we would go back east, although we had
enjoyed California very much and I felt so much freer out here as a teacher
and a scholar...so when this Stanford call came, I was ready to try to make it
work at all costs. Now Lorenz was in on the appointment of course, because
he was the head of the department. He was a continuous chair of the
department from ’63 until he retired in...
Fryberger: 1989.
Corn: [00:39:12] 1989. But he was on sabbatical that term. So when I came out for
my interview...my interview committee, best I can remember it, included
Suzanne Lewis and...
Fryberger: ...who was the medievalist.

30

Corn: [00:39:33] ...who was the medievalist and the senior woman in the
department, the only woman who had gotten tenure and been there for some
time. And then there was Al, Nate Oliveira, and I think I met Keith Boyle
on this particular trip. This was a trip to basically meet faculty but not
students. In those days, I don’t think we hired the same way we make hires
now, where everybody gets to meet everybody and everybody gets a voice in
the hiring process. And Al showed me a good time. I think I had a dinner at
Nate’s. Nate and Mona were wonderful cooks and we had just a terrific
time. And somebody gave me a campus tour and you know, I was treated
very, very well and was excited about the teaching possibility.
[00:40:28] Then Joe got a position in American studies at Stanford and in
what today is the STS program -- Science, Technology and Society. His
appointment bridged those two programs. Eventually he would become a
senior lecturer in the history department. When we took our positions at
Stanford, Lorenz was back from sabbatical. And of course we were all
housed in the Nathan Cummings Art Building. One of Lorenz’ great
achievements was not only forming a department as Betsy said and graduate
program and getting the museum going, but he also raised the money and he
got a new building for studio art and art history in one complex.
[00:41:19] And I must say one of my first revelations about how nice it was
going to be teaching at Stanford was the fact that in that one building, I
could get my slides for my lectures, I could go to the art library, I could walk
down the hall to my classroom. One could be there from nine in the
morning until nine at night and never step outdoors because every bit of the

31

university world that you wanted was in that one building. And if indeed you
wanted books at the main library, you just walked out the door and down a
building or two and there you were. I just loved the convenience and the
smartness of that building. In fact I loved that building my entire career
there. It was almost too tidy. I mean everything was there but Lorenz was
like that. Lorenz understood what art historical needs were but he was also
very efficient about space. And I think he was very efficient about, you
know, making a program work and it worked best if it was all self-contained
in one building and not scattered all over the university, which is how it was
when he arrived in 1963.
Fryberger: Yes, it was.
Corn: [00:42:27] So what to say about Lorenz? He was an amazingly fine
administrator. He didn’t always see eye to eye with the central university but
he was a builder. There had been a moment when he considered finishing
the job here and going to be chair of the art history department at Princeton.
I think that has happened just before I arrived in 1980, but then he decided
at the last minute not to take that Princeton appointment where he was really
being asked to do exactly the same thing at Princeton that he had done at
Stanford, which was to build a department and to work with the art museum
and so on.
[00:43:16] And Lorenz had brought Al Elsen in and these two men saw eyeto-eye on many things. They had their moments of disagreeing with one
another, which probably we just can leave aside, but one thing that they saw

32

eye-to-eye on was the museum. In making a great program, they had to have
a great museum. Was Al an official curator?
Fryberger: No. Honorary.
Corn: [00:43:54] Honorary curator, you wouldn’t know the difference frankly
[laughter] because of the way he acted but he was that kind of allencompassing person who of course built the Rodin collection at Stanford
and...
Fryberger: And worked very closely with Hunk Anderson. In those days...
Corn: [00:44:12] Hunk Anderson, yes. Elsen was a consultant of sorts to Hunk and
Moo (Mr. and Mrs. Harry W. Anderson), right?
Fryberger:

He was, he was. In the early years, the museum had a number of exhibitions
from the Andersons’ collection.

Corn: [00:44:26]...and Al was always on the move. Lorenz was less on the move.
Lorenz tended to be kind of stationary...it was hard to even get him to take a
sabbatical sometimes because he had so much to do at Stanford and he
didn’t travel that much as I remember. But Al, you never knew when Al
might be in New York or leading a travel-study trip abroad or helping a
collection happen. For years there was a secret he loved to hint at, that he
served on the selection committee for the MacArthur genius awards; this was
verified for me when I took over his office at his death because I found a
whole stack of videos of artists who had been considered for the genius
awards [laughter] that were left behind on one of his shelves.
[00:45:18] And Al was a lawyer of course, or at least his father was a lawyer
and art law was one of his interests. He worked very closely with John

33

Merryman and they wrote a textbook on art law. Some of his students like
Kirk Varnedoe became equally interested in art law and, I believe, Kirk for a
time taught art law at NYU when he went back to New York. So Al actually
initiated the whole field of art and the law, if I have it right.
Fryberger: I think that’s true.
Corn: [00:45:52] He and John Merryman would teach a course, either once a year in
spring term or once every other year. And the course would be held in the
law school and it would be for students in law, but also students in art
history. The art history students who took it were ever so grateful for that
course, especially those that were going to go on and have careers in
museums, because art law plays its role, of course, in all kinds of hot button
issues that hit the museums.
Fryberger: While Eitner was chair, there was a great deal of cooperation with some of
the other people in the department, not just Al, but in terms of mounting
exhibitions and having graduate students help mount exhibitions and so on.
And I don’t know if you were somewhat involved in this, but many of the
graduate students actually did dissertation work and Lorenz would buy like a
Jacques-Louis David drawing because somebody was working on David for
their dissertation. So there was really a very close integration...and he always
thought about what students would or could use and Lorenz regularly gave a
seminar in the museum about...that much, you know...debated word,
connoisseurship, that was really quite wonderful. There really hasn’t been
anything like that in recent years at the art department. But can you talk a

34

little bit about what sort of projects the graduate students had when you were
the chair of the department and how the department evolved?
Corn: [00:47:37] Lorenz got the graduate program going but it really came into its
own...at least it got bigger and better known in the late 1980s. I can
remember the number of applications growing from maybe thirty applicants
for four grad student fellowship slots to, by the time I retired, somewhere
around seventy to ninety applications each year. One year we had close to a
hundred. And my sense was that those numbers were much bigger than in
its earlier years. That was partially because graduate programs were growing
everywhere. It was also partially because the College Art Association got
involved in publishing manuals that advised students which graduate
programs to go to for special fields, and we were able to boast between
Eitner, Elsen, Corn, Paul Turner of major strength in nineteenth and
twentieth century European and American art.
[00:49:00] And increasingly, the student applicant pool moved towards those
fields, with one exception and that’s Asian art. Asian art has always had a
central place in the Stanford department. Michael Sullivan...didn’t Lorenz
hire Michael Sullivan? Yes. He was a major scholar in Asian art. He also
wrote a major textbook. I should also say that Al Elsen also wrote a major
survey textbook. Writing major textbooks was one way of coming to great
notice in the national scene of art history. Sullivan had written one and
Elsen had written one that was used as an alternative to Jansen’s and was
widely used. So in any case, as I think about it, the grad program was much
smaller when I arrived, and as I heard it -- I don’t know if this is true -- it was

35

more local. That is, students would come from California let’s say...the state
of California and now students come to us from all over the country and
even the world.
[00:50:05] I remember being thrilled when we started to get applications
from some of the highly respected undergraduate programs, like Bryn Mawr
and Swarthmore. For a while there, we had a student in our program, almost
all the time from Swarthmore, Harvard occasionally, Yale and Oberlin and
Williams College. So whenever we had applicants from that particular caliber
of school, we were feeling pretty good about our pool. We were always
restricted by not having sufficient fellowship monies. So in the early years, it
was three and then it was four students a year that we were bringing into the
program and let’s say one of those students studied Asian, two of them
might be in modern art, and then a fourth might have been in one of the
other fields, medieval, renaissance...
Fryberger:

So there was a really nice spread?

Corn: [00:51:12] It was a spread.
Fryberger: Sort of a healthy spread. Do you want to just jump ahead a little bit and
comment? I think now it’s almost all modern.
Corn: [00:51:21] Well this is a trend that’s...
Fryberger: It’s national.
Corn: [00:51:24] ...that’s national and in fact it’s become a topic at our national
meetings of the College Art Association and it has been called a crisis. The
movement towards twentieth century studies in art history has almost
eliminated the study of pre-twentieth century art at many schools. In the big

36

graduate schools you still have students in many different fields but
something is happening. There’s some seismic shift [laughter] that we’re
concerned about. You know there have been seismic shifts pedagogically in
the past. Once upon a time, we all had to know Latin and Greek when we
went through college and we don’t have to do that anymore and who knows
what the art history program in the future is going to look like as we all try to
respond to students’ interests.
Fryberger: What about in American studies at Stanford, did you work with colleagues in
history...
Corn: [00:52:26] Yes. That’s a very good question. So when I came to Stanford, of
course, I was allowed finally to be an Americanist, that’s what we call
ourselves in art history and that means somebody who studies the history of
American art up to, let’s say World War II. I quickly discovered that I had
two communities, my art history community, but there was also a very strong
interdisciplinary program of American studies at Stanford and that was an
undergraduate degree, not a graduate one.
Fryberger:

When did that start?

Corn: [00:52:58] I don’t know when it started to tell you the truth but I think it was
in the fifties. During the cold war, American studies programs popped up all
over the globe, [laughter] but they got their start nationally at Yale and at
Harvard in the thirties. Traditionally, American studies programs were heavy
on literature and history and then if you were lucky, you had an art unit. The
art unit only began to really press itself into American studies in the 1970s...I
think the first time I ever went to the national meeting of the American

37

Studies Association was in the early 1980s. Today there’s a visual arts caucus
within the American Studies Association that art historians dominate,
including a number of my former graduate students.
[00:54:01] What struck me as interesting about American studies at Stanford
is how heavy political science and government and economics were in the
program here and that, of course, was because those departments had
academic strength at Stanford. Humanities did not dominate the American
studies program here the way it did in traditional programs. Anyway it was a
very, very nice home for me. Both Joe and I participated in and helped the
advisors and leaders in the American studies program for the entire time we
were at Stanford. It was a very important place for our courses to live. It
also meant that I would get students in my art history courses that might not
have come if they hadn’t found me and art through the American studies
program...they may have taken American history courses with David
Kennedy for instance, or taken English courses with Al Gelpi. Al was very
sympathetic to art history and he would send undergraduates and graduate
students my way.
[00:55:14] I should say something about what happened to American art
during my tenure at Stanford. In 1995, I’d been at Stanford for fifteen years.
I was then on a leave of absence from the art department for a three year
term as chair of the Humanities Center. An anonymous donor, someone
who really appreciated the growth and development of the study of
American art at Stanford, made the university a transformative gift to
strengthen the program in American art in our department. And that gift

38

included an endowment for the hiring of another art historian who
concentrated on some aspect of historic American art. The gift also
provided four years of fellowship training for two new graduate students
who wanted to study American art each year. So at one point we had...in the
fourth year--eight students in the doctoral program focused on American art.
There was money also for a symposium on some topic in American art every
year that would bring in major scholars and younger voices in the field.
[00:56:53] Those were the golden years of American art at Stanford and I
didn’t serve a second term as Chair of the Humanities Center because of this
gift. Otherwise I would have stayed on but I could not do both jobs. One
had to give way to the other. I’ve never counted exactly how many students
went through our doctoral program in American art during those years, but I
know that I myself had something like twenty-five primary advisees during
my teaching years at Stanford. And then I was second and third reader on
probably another twenty-five dissertations. But from 1995 to about 2005, we
attracted wonderful graduate students to study American art.
The initial gift endowed the chair but the other funding was a seed gift with
the hopes that Stanford, the university, would pick up the graduate
fellowships funding after the program got established. Today the
professorship is held by Bryan Wolf and earlier it was Alexander Nemerov.
Alex Nemerov was the first professor of American art that we brought in
with the gift.
[00:58:11] He was not a chair holder because he was young and this was his
first position, but he came as the endowed professorship that we received

39

with this American art gift. We call this the DAD gift, DAD standing for
Deeply Anonymous Donor, because the donor demanded anonymity. So it
was always easier just to say things like, we thank DAD for this funding of
the symposium or having students write me letters to DAD about the
fellowships that they were enjoying, which we called the DAD fellowships,
and I would see that DAD received such communications.
Fryberger: Did the university later pick up the tab?
Corn: [00:59:02] No, no, I can say that...
Fryberger: Any part of it? No?
Corn: [00:59:05] No. The university, I have to say let us down. I always had the
sympathetic ear of deans but it would have meant fundraising for very
specific fellowships in American art, in order to continue the program we
had developed. If I have one major disappointment, professionally and
academically and about my time at Stanford, which was by and large
everything I might have wished for, was my disappointment that the
university never acknowledged what we had grown in our department. Our
American art doctoral program came to be known nationally. There were
two places for a while that grad students wanting to study American art most
wanted to go. One was Yale and one was Stanford.
[01:00:05] So we really put Stanford’s art history program on the map and it
had spillover, beautiful spillover for my colleagues because, first of all, I had
two fellowships just dedicated to my field. And that meant the other four
fellowships from the university could go to students in other fields. It took
the pressure off those four precious fellowships and really allowed the

40

graduate program to grow overall. The other thing it did was bring grad
students into the program who often migrated to do interdisciplinary work
with Michael Marrinan, who’s a nineteenth century Europeanist or with Pam
Lee in contemporary art. I know some of my colleagues were a little jealous
when the gift arrived and thought it might skew the program.
[01:00:56] But in the long run, I think everyone recognized that it was such
an injection of programmatic strength...I guess today we would say it brought
robustness, a favorite word of today, to our department. I honestly think
that the Stanford deans never quite got it. I guess they were happy that the
money was there and that we did something with it but they never invested
in making it a secure program and there always was this element of
insecurity, that is, that this was a startup that was supposed to make
something happen at Stanford. Stanford often had startups. This is not
peculiar at all. It’s hard in the humanities with any startup programs, so...
Fryberger: Well I was going to say that humanities don’t have the clout of engineering
or some of the other schools and it probably is as much a reflection of the
sort of general lack of strength of the humanities at Stanford, don’t you
think?
Corn: [01:02:11] Yes, and so we’ve lost the leadership we once had in the study of
American art. It has not helped that the deans didn’t replace me in a timely
fashion. I’m still not replaced and I’ve been out for four years.
Fryberger: Can you comment on some of the areas that your students wrote their
dissertations?

41

Corn: [01:02:28] Yes. You asked me that question before and I got off on another
run. My students...let’s see if I can generalize. I wish I had a list of them
here. My field of interest I should quickly say, is late nineteenth-century and
early twentieth-century American art. I taught two courses that were catalytic
of projects. One was “Art and Culture in the Gilded Age” and the other
course was called “Transatlantic Modernism, Paris and New York in the
Early Twentieth Century.” Along with those courses, I took a special interest
in the history of women and I had another special interest in the art of the
1930s, in American regionalism.
[01:03:25] Of my first two advisees, one of them wrote on the Fourteenth
Street School. That was Ellen Todd and her work included a very strong
chapter on Isabel Bishop, a woman artist. The Fourteenth Street School was
then unknown, having been left out of American history; it was a group of
artists of the 1920s and 30s who had come together as a loose forming
“school.” My second advisee was Cécile Whiting, who wrote about social
realism in the 1930s. Subsequently, she’s written on pop art and she’s
become more of a scholar of post-1945 art, but at the time, she picked up on
my interest in the thirties.
Fryberger: And the museum did an exhibition about William Gropper’s work, which
Cécile...
Corn: [01:04:14] ...Cécile worked on that exhibition, that’s right, that’s good. I
don’t remember about Ellen, whether she did...
Fryberger: I don’t think...well, somebody did an exhibition about Isabel Bishop. We
had a group of prints from, you know, AAA (Association of American

42

Artists) that were published in the thirties, when you could buy prints for five
dollars.
Corn: [01:04:33] Oh yes, I was involved in that one actually. Yes, we borrowed
from the woman in Menlo Park. I got involved in that because I remember
going to her house...
Fryberger:

...because I think the exhibition grew out of her collection.

Corn: [01:04:47] Yes, that’s right, and we did have a student curator. I think it was
Charlotte Wellman. You remember that name?
Fryberger: Oh, I do.
Corn: [01:04:57] Sherry [Charlotte Wellman] wrote her dissertation on Sheeler, but
I think she helped with the associated artist (AAA) exhibition. So there’s
another link. Sherry wrote a very interesting dissertation on Charles Sheeler’s
late life style. Then I had students that worked on social history topics like
Lesley Wright who wrote on the patronage for sentimental genre painting in
the late nineteenth century. I hosted a number of dissertations on
contemporary art. David Cateforis wrote about the art criticism of
DeKooning’s paintings of women and Jo Ortel wrote on the early work of
Niki de Saint Phalle.
Fryberger: So in general, would you say that the emphasis had really shifted away from
sort of more traditional studies of individual artists to a more cultural setting
of the artist.
Corn: [01:05:57] Yes, I would say yes.
Fryberger: And this would happen in all areas of art.

43

Corn: [01:06:01] Exactly, and it had happened during the moment when everyone
was talking about the death of the author. [Laughter] Students were almost
embarrassed if they did monographic studies on one artist. So yes, this was
definitely a moment when social history became very sophisticated and we
were all looking at economic factors, looking at the ideological issues during
a particular moment, particularly during the 1930s, where people were either
very patriotic or very anti-patriotic. Communism was a part of the American
scene and there was lots of political and social art being made. So the
students did tend to find topics with a social historical bent, particularly in
the eighties, I would say, and then by the mid-nineties, it became acceptable
again to work on a single artist but you didn’t do the whole artist as had once
been popular. You did selected aspects of that artist’s work,
monographically.
[01:07:00] A few dissertations that I’m really proud of are ones in fields
where we didn’t really have a specialist in the department; these students, just
like me, self-educated themselves to write their dissertations. We had two
African American dissertations of note by African American students and
they helped bring African American art into the program and our lecture
series (Gwendolyn Shaw and Cherise Smith). And you know, when they
were teaching assistants, they helped me introduce artists of color into my
courses and sections. I was also very proud of a dissertation Carolyn Kastner
did, which was on Native American rugs and blankets and collectors and
very anthropological in approach. I was happy that I could sponsor this
work. One of the reasons we could do that...I forgot to mention this--was

44

that the DAD gift also allowed us to have a visiting professor each year.
[01:08:11] Every year, we had a visiting faculty member whose scholarship
was in some aspect of American art that was not being covered by either me,
or the second position in American art. We would bring in someone like Dell
Upton to teach American architecture. And when Carolyn Kastner was
doing her dissertation on Native American art, we brought in Aldona Jonaitis
who could be an advisor to her and, in fact, stayed on her committee because
of her expertise in the topic. Aldona was then director of the University of
Alaska Museum of the North. She helped Carolyn develop a methodology
for her dissertation and that was terrific. Ellen Todd was also one of those
visitors, having been a student in the program twenty years earlier. She
became an important adviser to a couple of students who were writing
Gilded Age dissertations. That visitor program also brought us Bryan Wolf.
His first stay at Stanford was as a visitor here and he, I must say, had an
immediate love affair with Stanford and was very eager to be considered for
the open position in American art when it came around much later. Alan
Wallach came as a visitor during those years. Another important name in
American art history, Margaretta Lovell came over from UC Berkeley and
was also there for a term. Anyway it was very dynamic, and these scholars of
course taught not just Americanists but they taught undergraduates and
everybody else in the department. So they were another way in which the
program got kind of revved up and became very exciting because we had
bigger critical masses at all levels and I think that’s...

45

Fryberger: Were some of the courses for undergraduates and were these courses
particularly popular? Can you comment a little bit about sort of the number
of undergraduate art...
Corn: [01:10:15] History, yes.
Fryberger:

...either history majors or studio majors. Has it changed...

Corn: [01:10:20] Well, you know, I can’t speak to today’s constituencies because I
don’t know who they are. But I think it’s fair to say that when I came to
Stanford in the early eighties, art history was what I would call a service
department, and I don’t mean that disrespectfully because Lorenz Eitner and
Elsen were brilliant teachers and each of them could almost fill Annenberg
Auditorium with their lecture courses. Whether it was a broad survey course
or in the case of Elsen, it might be his course on the history of modern
sculpture. He also taught an introductory survey course and so did Lorenz
Eitner. Lorenz’ courses on French modernism and French romantic art were
also well attended but I don’t remember how many majors we had when I
arrived.
[01:11:10] I don’t remember that getting students to major in art history was
an emphasis. The emphasis was to do courses that would pull in the
engineers and pull in the people from science and math and maybe
economics. For the longest time, I taught my Paris-New York course that
fulfilled a requirement for the major in International Relations, and I filled
Annenberg because there are a lot of majors in International Relations at
Stanford. Students had to take a humanities course and this course became
one way to do it, I think. I didn’t, I have to say, enjoy teaching it as much as

46

I did my smaller courses because I thought some students were there just
because it was a part of their major and not because they really wanted to be
there or had elected to be there.
[01:11:55] But needless to say, the art history department did very, very well
in attracting students from across the board. Then as majors became more
important to the students and students began to be more career-conscious-which I think developed in the late eighties and nineties--and parents got
involved because college costs were getting higher and higher--art history
courses had to justify themselves. Students (and their parents) now began to
think they better elect a major that will prepare them for a job. I remember
the department talking a lot about, how do we get majors as opposed to how
do we get students into our classes. It really was a change in focus as art
history had never been a popular major like English or history departments
that had always had the highest counts of undergraduate majors in the
humanities. Of course, our count of majors could be slippery because you
could say the department had forty majors and only twenty of them would be
in art history and the rest in studio art.
[01:13:09] So we began to be very conscious of our majors and in the good
years we might have upwards of thirty to forty art history majors but that was
always a figure that went up and down. And when the university decided to
have minors, we worried in our department that our numbers of majors
would go down, and they did. It had become popular on campus for students
to declare double majors and it was killing the students. And very often it
was killing the teachers because the students couldn’t find a way to complete

47

the requirements you wanted for a major in art history and would ask for
exceptions to the rules. So the School of Humanities and Science, realizing
that this was becoming a bad habit and trend amongst undergraduates, asked
departments to create minors with the idea that you could, going through
Stanford, elect one major and one minor.
[01:14:05] When that happened, the art department had just taken on film
studies and we created two minors, one in art history and one in film studies.
That, I think, satisfied students who previously were trying to complete two
majors, one of them in art history. We used to say one major for the parents
and one major for the students’ souls and the major for the souls were the
ones of course in our department. Well now it became usually a major in
economics or international relations or one of the science fields, Hum Bio
(Human Biology) and so on. Then they might elect a minor in our
department. So I think at that point, our majors stopped growing and what
began to grow were the number of minors and I don’t really know where we
are today, in terms of student enrollments.
Fryberger: I realize we haven’t talked about photography when you mentioned film
studies. I mean photography...Leo Holub started teaching photography, but
not the history of photography. Joel Leivick, who followed Leo, taught
occasionally the history of photography. Given the broad appeal of
photography, both...I guess practicing or studio photography courses have
always been enormously popular. I don’t know how history of photography
fared as a course and maybe it simply wasn’t popular enough, but you have
interest in photography, so...

48

Corn: [01:15:39] Yes, I’ve had a long interest in photography, partially because my
father was a pretty good amateur photographer and partially because he got
so interested in the technology of photography that he put together a
massive collection of old cameras. And I say “massive” with some depth of
feeling because I had to disburse it after he died. He also collected
nineteenth century photographs. He wasn’t so interested in the twentieth
century, although he did buy two Ansel Adams at my suggestion when I
found a good selection of them at one point. But those were the only
twentieth century photographs he had. Otherwise he had mostly portraits,
daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes. In any case, when I was at Mills, we
had to have our new courses approved by a curriculum committee. And I
started to teach the history of photography in some small way.
[01:16:40] I think it was a lecture course but it might have been a seminar.
And then when I got to Stanford, I was thrilled that there was really a serious
component to the studio department here in photography. Serious, yes, but
it has never been given the academic faculty appointments it should have.
It’s always been the case that teachers in photography are lecturers or senior
lecturers and not full professors. This was because photography came very
late into the department and it was kind of a poor stepchild as a result. The
wonderful Leo Holub had put it together. He had an amazing dark room,
funky and kind of smelly, as dark rooms are likely to be, under the art gallery
that was next door to Cummings. And he was such a gentle soul and so
much the spirit of the place even though he had stopped teaching by the time

49

I had arrived, and the department was on the verge of hiring Laura
Volkerding.
[01:17:50] I was not part of that search but she came very shortly after I
came. Then I believe Joel Leivick came aboard. But in the interim there was
a kind of a bare spot and I taught the history of photography. When Joel
came along...and I was having trouble squeezing in the photography course
with all my other commitments, especially as the graduate program began to
swell, then I had to let some things go that I was doing at an undergraduate
level. So Joel taught it but then at one point, Joel and I were kind of
alternating teaching some aspect of photographic history. We were teaching
it every other year. He’d do it and then I would do it. It never really became
a stable commodity in our department.
[01:18:46] But somehow we managed. Then what happened, which is really
interesting is that we began to get younger faculty, like Leah Dickerman who
was on our faculty for a little bit and she just took photography to be a
natural part of what you taught when you taught modern art. You integrated
painting, sculpture, printmaking and photography. In other words, I found
myself a little old fashioned all of a sudden with this kind of singular course,
although I still think there’s definitely a place for the history of photography
in the curriculum. But she began teaching photography as a fully integrated
part of the visual culture of any particular moment. And I realized that I’ve
got to be doing the same thing. I didn’t always need to keep photography off
on its own little shelf for teaching purposes.

50

[01:19:36] So I, in the later years, began to bring Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand,
and Ansel Adams into my courses on American modernism. I think that’s
more or less what’s happened today, that if you take art history courses on
anything nineteenth century, early twentieth century, you’re likely to have a
component that has something to do with photography.
Fryberger: Whoever’s been teaching photography, both studio and history, they’ve been
among the more regular faculty users of...
Corn: [01:20:08] ...your collection.
Fryberger: ...the museum’s collection. It was not just Joel, but I mean Summer Sessions
and then Continuing Studies had somebody teaching a photography course
and they’ve really made a big use of the photography collection. Let’s switch
to the museum. You were at the museum only briefly, but it was a very
dramatic period in its history. And everybody always likes to hear personal
earthquake reminiscences (Loma Prieta Earthquake, 1989). [laughter] I had
been at a meeting with you and Carol Osborne and some other people at the
main office, just before the earthquake, but I had to leave to go home for
some reason. So I had left. I was outside the building and I saw the building
move and the ground shake. And actually I thought I was having a heart
attack at first but then when I saw the ground shaking and so on, I figured it
out. But Wanda and Carol were still in the museum. Why don’t you tell us
about your experience and your memories?
Corn: [01:21:04] Betsy, thank you for that recollection because I was just thinking,
why wasn’t Betsy under that table with the rest of us? [Laughter] Because
we had just had this staff meeting and I forget whether it was Anita Mozley

51

or Susan Roberts-Manganelli who was sitting over where the typewriters
were, over at a counter on...
Fryberger: It was Susan.
Corn: [01:21:26] It was Susan I think maybe. So we were just standing around
shooting the breeze, I think. The earthquake struck and it was my first really
big one. I’d had one semi-big one before but this was as big as I’d ever
experienced and never would like to experience, frankly. I think Carol dove
under the table. I went into a doorway and Susan dove under the counter.
When the shaking stopped, we regrouped, walked through the museum and
as we walked into the rotunda, we could see the cracks in the building. I
remember looking particularly at the tops of doorways because I knew that
we had had an incident where a keystone of marble once, without even the
instigation [laughter] of an earthquake, had dropped from a doorway into the
entrance hall. So I remember looking there first to see that it had stayed in
place--and it had. One of the guards was still in the building and she was
very traumatized.
Fryberger: She was freaked out.
Corn: [01:22:29] She was totally freaked out and she was just pointing to the cracks
in the walls. I don’t know if I saw the sky through the cracks that day, but
later we certainly were aware that you could see the cracks went all the way
through the walls and we could see light. We all regrouped in front of the
museum. Were you then part of that group outside?
Fryberger: Yes.

52

Corn: [01:22:53] And we also had a lot of people racing out of the downstairs
conference room. The Committee for Art had been having a meeting of their
officers or something like that and so there were ten or so of them. I
remember Daryl Carey was one of them.
Fryberger: And Lorenz Eitner...
Corn: [01:23:11] And Lorenz. But I can’t remember him outside the building.
Lorenz, we now know...
Fryberger: He came down ashen faced from his new study on the second floor of the
museum.
Corn: [01:23:18] Oh, did he?
Fryberger: Well of course in the second floor, you really feel it.
Corn: [01:23:21] Yes, he was in his brand new museum office. Lorenz had to retire
by the age limitation, seventy it was at that point. That’s when I became his
successor in the chairman’s office of the art department, and then I also
became a successor for two years as an interim director of the museum. I
heard the story later that Lorenz had been in his retirement museum office,
and I think I also remember him saying he hadn’t done anything but just sort
of sit there during it all. We all felt that he was so lucky that something
hadn’t dropped on his head. But I also remember that I lived in San
Francisco at the time and was worried about our house on Dolores Street.
Joe eventually made his way over to find me in front of the museum.
[01:24:07] He had been standing in front of the old Green Library when the
earthquake hit, having watched the water slosh dramatically in the fountains.
Our car was at the museum in the back. One of the parked cars, I think, had

53

had something fall on it. Our car was okay, but we didn’t have enough gas to
get home. And Daryl Carey loaned us her car to get home. Somehow I
think we took her home or we gave her our car, which had enough gas to get
where she lived. I had been in the museum director’s job less than a month I
think. We had installed one major exhibition...do you remember the name of
the sculptor?
Fryberger: I’ve suppressed it. [Laughter]
Corn: [01:25:02] He was a Belgian ceramics sculptor and we had given him a party
at his opening and the school year was barely underway...
Fryberger:

That’s right, we put up an exhibition about the French revolution and we
had just finished putting it up and then the museum was closed because of
the earthquake. It was an exhibition that no one ever saw.

Corn: [01:25:26] And one of the nice stories that I can remember is...you have to
give me the name of the guy who had done so much of the installation of
our Greek and Roman collection and other things...
Fryberger: Oh, Frank....
Corn: [01:25:40] Yes, Frank...
Fryberger: Frank Kommer, the carpenter who also made special mounts.
Corn: [01:25:42] Kommer. Frank was on the road home at the time of the
earthquake. He had left the building, but he came whipping back and he
asked permission of me because I guess I was the person in charge at that
point, to go back into the building and assess damage and also, as it turned
out, lock windows that had jiggled open and just check and make sure that
everything was locked up. That was very brave of him and very nice and very

54

concerned. I remember telling him he could go into the museum but he had
to be out in fifteen minutes and we were going to clock him. I don’t know
what I was thinking because if another earthquake came, he could have been
a goner.
[01:26:28] But we did really need that security check and I was very grateful
that Frank went into the museum. First of all, when he came back out, he
told us exactly what had fallen down and what hadn’t as he more or less had
looked quickly at everything. He’d raced through and took a special interest
in assessing mounts he had created to stabilize sculptures and pots, hoping
they would hold up in an earthquake. But they had never been tested. At the
time there really wasn’t much of a science of earthquake installation. So
Frank came back out and he gave us a damage report, which was not bad,
with the exception of our Belgian sculptor.
Fryberger: José Vermeersch.
Corn: [01:27:02] Vermeersch, that’s right. And his pieces were freestanding life size
figurative ceramics and he had not wanted any of them secured to the walls.
He didn’t want any fishing line used or other earthquake security measures
that had been suggested. I remember Carol Osborne had been the curator in
charge of the installation, right? And she had asked him if she could stabilize
them in the event of a quake and he said, no, no, no, no, no, because he was
concerned about the aesthetics of tethering the pieces to the wall.
[01:27:40] So in fact, the pieces did suffer a lot of earthquake damage in that
exhibition. But in terms of the permanent collection that Frank and his
colleagues had installed, the damage was slight, relatively speaking to other

55

museums. I will tell one other quick anecdote. The decision we all made the
evening of the quake was that we as a staff would regroup the next day...this
is the way I remember it. Or maybe there were some phone calls that made
this regrouping happen, but we were to meet at noon in front of the building
and Lorenz’ teams always had food as a part of all celebrations. Lorenz
loved food but so did his curators. They were great food makers, including
Betsy Fryberger, who’s conducting this interview.
[01:28:30] And so we all decided we would do a picnic at a picnic table that
was out in front of the museum. Now do you remember this? It might have
been just Carol, me, and a couple of others. Anyway we brought food and
we awaited our security team from the university. Yellow lines had gone up
all around the museum. So nobody was allowed in and Frank could never
have gotten in at this point. The idea was that we would go into the museum
with university officials, all of us in hard hats, and assess the damage to the
museum. Well we waited and we waited and we waited and finally, I don’t
know, mid-afternoon the team came. I’m almost positive Carol was with me
but I don’t know whether she went with me to the roof of the building.
[01:29:23] I had never been on the roof of the museum and I felt that as
director I should do exactly what everybody else was doing because I was of
course responsible for the building. I was going to have to answer to
whatever they were going to tell us we had to do or not do with our facility.
So that’s the first time I ever went up on the roof. And up there we saw
structural damage that we could not see from down below. Most
significantly, the balustrade that went across the museum facade...it’s no

56

longer there...was broken in several places and big chunks of it were either
lying on the roof or when we went back down to the ground and looked
around the building, there were chunks of it lying around, that we just, hadn’t
really paid any attention. I have a chunk of the balustrade in my Stanford
collection.
Fryberger: Yes, I have a small chunk in my garden too. [Laughter]
Corn: [01:30:14] In any case, it suddenly dawned on me how lucky we all were that
nothing like that had careened into one of us and also [laughter] how stupid
we were to have this picnic on a table that was very close to the façade of the
building. Had there been another great big shake, we might have been in the
line of fire for a piece of the falling balustrade. At that point, whenever we
gathered outside the museum we stood further away from the building. But
anyway, these are some earthquake anecdotes of the museum and as history
shows, we were down and out without a museum for ten years.
Fryberger: ...for ten years and Tom Seligman was hired about a year later.
Corn: [01:30:56] ...a year later.
Fryberger: And the whole collection was moved into storage, in a former men’s locker
room...
Corn: [01:31:03] ...a gym of some sort, right?
Fryberger: ...the old gym and so the basketball court was filled with a jungle gym of
support systems to store all of this and the prints and drawings...this is my
favorite part. Prints, drawings and photographs were stored in the former
shower area [laughter] but...
Corn: [01:31:23] With water still running through those pipes?

57

Fryberger: No, no, no. Anyway it was a long rebuilding and this isn’t the place because I
think Wanda wants to talk about...
Corn: [01:31:31] No, but the one thing I would like to add to the record was the
fact that I had to stay for a second year as interim director because nobody
wanted to be the new director of a broken museum. We were supposed to
be searching in the 1989-90 year but the university wasn’t sure they were
going to rebuild the museum. For the record, I must say the university
officials were scared after the earthquake. The church had had serious
damage. The business school had had serious damage. And the university-this is well known--had just gone on to a self-insurance plan, so they didn’t
have any insurance money coming in, and had to fundraise for rebuilding
funds, totally unexpectedly.
[01:32:17] My darkest moment was when the administration asked me to let
all the staff go, not just the guards but all the curators, including you. They
weren’t particular. They just felt a museum that was down had no need to be
curated anymore.
Fryberger: Was this a provost decision?
Corn: [01:32:49] Well I don’t know if it was provost or presidential, but I remember
having to make an argument that curators would have more than enough to
do because the collection had to be moved and taken care of. There still
needed to be research done. In fact I also at that point invented this
argument that this would be a golden opportunity to photograph everything
we owned at the museum, which had never been done before and that we

58

could actually catalogue it during this down time and of course we didn’t
know how long we were going to be down.
[01:33:27] We weren’t thinking ten years at that point. I was thinking more
like two or three. So I basically refused...or I basically asked if I could come
up with as much argument as possible to keep the curatorial staff on the
payroll. We allowed the guards to be placed elsewhere in the university
having to let them go after a period of time. I think there was some kind of
program for downsizing. But that was a very scary moment for me because
it also was clear that the university was not yet ready to make a commitment
to rebuilding the museum. The administrators looked very seriously at taking
down the damaged building and putting up a new facility. And the way they
thought of a new building was, to my mind, not more than a warehouse.
[01:34:19] It was just a big box that would be much cheaper than renovating
the old museum. They weren’t thinking of a building with character or any
special architectural features that we like to think our museums should have,
and they weren’t thinking about replacing all the square footage we had in
the old museum. These were times when the museum’s future looked very
dim. I put together a pan-university committee, with members drawn from
every department I could think of that supported the museum so that I was
speaking for the entire university and not just for the art department or the
art history department or the museum staff. I called it the SOM committee:
Save Our Museum.
[01:35:03] I felt that I needed to have a university base of people who would
speak to the provost and the president and might know them better than I

59

did. I got a lot of support that way. We were able to disband happily when it
was decided that the museum would be saved and spared and restored,
decisions that were helped a lot by FEMA promising the university money if
we restored the old building and didn’t tear it down and put up a new one.
[Interview paused.]
[Interview resumed.]
Fryberger: So this is Betsy Fryberger continuing the oral history interview with Wanda
Corn. This is our third session and Wanda now is going to talk a little bit
more generally about her working relationships and associations outside of
the art department and the museum, with her years at the Humanities Center,
but also about the women’s center on campus and the increasingly important
role that women played teaching at Stanford. So Wanda?
Corn: [01:36:33] Well, maybe we’ll first take the latter topic because it’s been very
much on my mind. I mentioned how important the women’s community
that I found here at Stanford was in my talk to the emeriti. When I say
women’s community, that makes it sound overly formal and it really wasn’t.
Before coming to Stanford, I had been teaching at Mills College, a women’s
college and self-identified as a feminist. But I didn’t identify as a feminist
scholar yet. I became a feminist scholar while I was at Stanford, that is, I
began to work on the history of women in art. I was encouraged in that
work by the number of women at Stanford researching women’s topics and
that was very inspirational for me.
[01:37:22] It made me feel as if we surely had equivalent kinds of questions
we might be asking about the history of art that had by and large bypassed

60

women and left them out. Basically art historians hadn’t thought women
artists made enough important art to be subjects of our intellectual inquiry.
Two or three things happened right at the get-go when I arrived at Stanford
that I will never forget. First of all, Estelle Freedman and Shelly Rosaldo
invited me and Joe out to lunch within a month of our arrival. I had met
Estelle at one former moment when she was in New York. I hadn’t seen
much of her but she was the one woman faculty member I think I could say
that I knew on campus.
[01:38:16] I don’t remember knowing any other female faculty member at
that time. I had to meet other female faculty members. But Stanford faculty
women were making it a point to make other women welcome. This little
lunch was really like a welcoming committee to your new neighborhood.
And then another thing happened. The women saw to it that new women
faculty gave inaugural lectures. I mean they made a big deal about it...giving
an inaugural lecture. Mine was at noon when much of the campus could
come. And I gave, on that occasion, a lecture about four women who
worked in the late Gilded Age and in early twentieth century America.
[01:39:17] Alice Austin was one of them that I can remember and I think
probably Mary Cassatt was another and then I can’t remember the other two
at the moment. However, Annenberg was filled, not just with women but
with other faculty and students. After that talk, I can remember getting
critiques. I have one critique from Estelle Freedman that I still hold on to
because I thought it was so right on. Basically she faulted me for not
knowing my history well enough. She had no trouble with my art history but

61

she knew far more than I did at the time about the history of women in the
Gilded Age and the ways in which they were emerging from motherhood
and spousal responsibilities to move onto a public stage.
[01:40:11] And that was extremely influential on me. Through her work, and
Estelle has always had an impact on what I do, she’s made me a much better
student of the history of women and helped me ground my work in the
history of women. I’ve done this to my own satisfaction in a new book I’ve
just published called Women Building History about the public
decorations at the Woman’s Building of the 1893 Chicago Fair. Estelle and
this group of women that I ran with were all associated with CROW (Center
for Research on Women) and really helped inspire that book. Though I
didn’t get it out until just this year, [laughter] it actually was a twenty-five year
sort of backburner project.
[01:40:54] So these are just a couple of activities that women at Stanford
helped me with. I’m not sure when the women’s faculty caucus was formed,
but I have the feeling it was in formation when I arrived, and I immediately
became involved in that. That was a pan-university caucus. All women
faculty members were invited to join it. It had no selection process and it
was taking up, in rather formal ways, topics of mutual interest across the
board. Some of those topics were around children, such as paid leave for
childbirth and slowing down the tenure clock to accommodate the making of
a family and so on. So the caucus took on topics that no men would ever
think about because these weren’t their issues. Eventually the caucus took on
salary inequities and the economists among us created a brilliant analysis of

62

the inequities in salary between men and women at the same career level.
Basically, as I recall, every tenured woman submitted her salary secretly to
one or two people who were able to get comparable figures for salaries of
male faculty. This study was completed when Condi Rice as I recall was
provost and President Gerhard Casper was president.
[01:42:50] Anyway the women in charge wrote an astounding report.
Without having to name names, they demonstrated the discrepancies
between senior women’s salaries and senior male salaries.
When the caucus has its meetings they were run in a large classroom that we
could all fit in. And then occasionally, there’d be lighter moments where we
would have dinners and speakers and so on.
Fryberger: How many tenured women were on the faculty then and how many women
came to some of these meetings?
Corn: [01:43:29] I don’t remember how many tenured women there were. But at
some point, I remember there were just under a hundred women in the
caucus. Whether that number included the medical school, I don’t
remember, but I just remember thinking, oh my goodness, I’m part of such a
small statistic. [Laughter] I was shocked at how few women there were on
the Stanford faculty relative to the bigger size of the university. The number
of women that would come to the caucus meetings could be thirty. It could
be near a hundred. It sort of depended what the topic was and it also
depended where we were in the history of the organization. Eventually the
caucus melted away but not before certain reforms were put in place. There
were reforms about leaves and slowing down the tenure clock for

63

pregnancies and birth and there were reforms around childcare. As some of
these things got kind of taken care of, the caucus lost more of its reason for
being.
Fryberger: Were other major universities enacting similar...
Corn: [01:44:27] Yes, there were major...
Fryberger: Was Stanford among the leaders or not?
Corn: [01:44:32] I don’t know but I’m not sure UC Berkeley had anything like it
going. And I think, if I’m not mistaken, a couple of the annual reports that
the women’s caucus issued, particularly the one around salaries became
models because I remember somebody asked me at Harvard about how it
had been constructed, saying nothing like the woman’s caucus existed there.
[01:45:12] I don’t know whether the women’s caucus is alive today. I do
know however that one of its initiatives was to establish a policy that is still
in effect. Every year at a particular senate meeting in the spring, there is an
annual report issued on the working conditions and the gain and losses to the
numbers of women faculty. We didn’t take on staff issues. These were
faculty issues. I always read the annual report on women each year when it is
delivered to the Senate and then printed in the Stanford Report.
[01:45:50] The issues don’t change: making sure that expanding departments
consider female candidates; making sure women are better represented in
departments where they are traditionally poorly represented, mostly math,
sciences, medical school and so on. I was in the caucus during the Fran
Conley days when she quit her job at the medical school. She was a part of

64

the caucus and I remember very clearly her standing on principle and
resigning from her department for its alleged sexism.
The other center of feminist activity was CROW. It had just been formed, as
had the feminist undergraduate major when I arrived.
[01:46:41] And I believe Estelle Freedman was a mover and shaker in the
making of the undergraduate major in feminist studies which was an
interdisciplinary major like American studies. I was on the committee for the
feminist major...no, I was on some kind of advisory committee for CROW in
my early years. I found it a very nice community to be a part of but I never
frankly seemed to have enough time for it. Crow often had workshops at
noon and I tended to teach at 1 p.m. so I never was able to participate as
much as I would have liked.
[01:47:29] But workshops I did participate in that I really enjoyed was when
we had at least one or two meetings on how to take a feminist approach to
things that were going wrong in the classroom. [laughter] You know, what
did you do when you had disruptive or sexist behavior on the part of male
students or what to do when there was somebody in class reading
newspapers or, I don’t know, what did you do when you had an honors
infringement. What we were trying to figure out was whether there was a
feminist way to teach or whether we were just following our male mentors
and the way they would have reacted in similar situations. I loved these
workshops because they were thoughtful and creative. We learned from one
another because we’d bring different kinds of classroom experience to the
table. And we would share research. Those were wonderful times. [01:48:21]

65

When people would give a paper or we’d read something ahead of time and
then we would sit and you know sort of chew it up and analyze it and try to
help our colleague get to a new plateau with whatever research she was
doing. I was much more active in CROW in my early years than my later
years. In the later years, CROW became more formalized. It got bigger. It
changed its name to The Center for the Study of Women and Gender to
broaden its mandate and include the study of men as well as the study of
sexuality.
[01:49:02] And the house was moved from where CROW was originally. I’ve
forgotten where on campus it was originally, but we had to get on our bikes
to go to it. Then the Center was moved next door to the former Humanities
Center in the old houses behind the music department. In any case, women
were very important in my first ten years at Stanford. I think after that, I just
become extremely busy with other activities and I wasn’t able to participate
as much as I wanted to. But another thing we did that probably should go
on record is we formed a buddy system so that every new woman faculty
member coming to campus, especially junior woman faculty member, was
assigned a buddy--a senior woman faculty member who would mentor the
new faculty member and help her get through the tenure process.
[01:50:06] I thought this was a very effective way to help mentor younger
faculty members. But I think the reason that this stopped is because at some
point every department was asked to provide a senior faculty mentor for
each junior faculty member. And I took on two mentees in my own

66

department. So here’s a case where the university took over a practice that
feminists had started and made it an all campus practice.
Fryberger: That’s great. On the subject of tenure, this is out of sequence but the art
department didn’t use to consider and maybe still doesn’t consider any
museum publication to be the equivalent of a book. So when you’re applying
for tenure, that’s one reason many faculty don’t want to write exhibition
catalogues. You expend a lot of time but it’s not recognized as being
significant. Is that still the case? And does it vary from university to
university?
Corn: [01:51:15] I think it does vary. It’s a complicated case because if you’ve
written a museum catalogue and you’ve curated an exhibition, you want
credit for not only the book but the exhibition into which you’ve put
enormous amounts of work, pulling together loans to make your thesis visual
and happen on the museum wall. Basically as you well know, putting
together an exhibition is sometimes two-thirds getting the exhibition together
and one-third getting the book out. And that’s because getting the exhibition
together just keeps eating away at the time you’d like to have doing the
catalogue. The deadline of an exhibition is very demanding and the
catalogue/book often suffers for it.
[01:52:06] It is true that across the country, museum publications, that is,
publications of catalogues that accompany exhibitions have been problematic
for tenure committees. Traditionally museum catalogues don’t get reviewed,
so they don’t have any feedback from an intellectual community. And, in
fact, I’d even say something that I feel very critical about, which is when

67

critics write museum exhibition reviews, they often never mention the
catalogue, never mention the curator’s name, and they review the show, but
not the scholarship that is behind the show.
Fryberger: That’s one of my longtime gripes.
Corn: [01:53:03] Yes, mine too. We’ll see how I fare on my new exhibition on
Gertrude Stein because I’ve just written what I think is a very important
accompanying book with my former student, Tirza Latimer. I’ll bet you that
the book is not mentioned whenever the exhibition is reviewed because
that’s always the experience I’ve had. Well that hurts at tenure time because
you don’t have book reviews. The other thing that hurts getting scholarly
credit for museum catalogues is that there’s no peer review. Maybe your
colleagues in the museum vet your manuscript and your publisher who wants
to make sure that you are speaking the King’s English gives you a copy
editor, but the text hasn’t gone through the rigor of the review process that
stand-alone essays in peer reviewed scholarly journals do, as do books
published by university presses.
[01:54:03] So there are good arguments that can be made either way. I
personally felt at Stanford that when I came in the department in the eighties,
I was not prejudiced against because of my museum publications. In fact all
that I had to my name at the time were museum publications. And because
Eitner and Elsen were such museum men and had themselves written so
many catalogues, they did not bring that prejudice to the table. However my
colleague in the history of American art at the University of California,
Berkeley, whose exhibitions and catalogues were done at the very same

68

museums as mine...like the de Young...had a terrible time with her tenure
review. She had to sue the university to reverse a denial of tenure, a suit that
she won.
[01:54:58] Her lawsuit brought this whole mess that we’re talking about, the
poor reputation that museum catalogues have in the academy to a head. And
I know similar cases. Over the years I’ve been called several times by chairs
of departments who are having trouble getting someone through the tenure
process and who asked me to testify because I have written museum
catalogues that still are being read and footnoted and quoted in scholarly
discourse. This is not a problem that’s ever going to go away, I don’t think,
and it’s probably gotten worse over the years, not better as you said when
you asked the question.
[01:55:59] It’s also the case that younger scholars are aware that they could
have trouble with museum catalogues and so they shy away from them until
they’ve gotten tenure and then they might turn to exhibitions again. But I
think I personally was very lucky in this regard. When I wrote my Grant
Wood catalogue in 1983, it became a standard study of Wood. It’s out of
print now but it’s still one of the few modern biographies and studies of
Wood’s art, so that it is often used as a reference. But when I wrote that
catalogue, I wrote it on Stanford time basically. I wrote it on my first
sabbatical at Stanford that I spent as a fellow in the brand new Stanford
Humanities Center. [01:56:46] And you know, that book got absorbed into
the footnotes of other art historians’ work so that I at least had those
citations to show for it. I didn’t shy away from that project because of any

69

worry that Stanford would think poorly of me. Al Elsen supported my doing
as many museum exhibitions as I wanted to because he was such a museum
professional himself. He encouraged and helped me. He looked over all my
contracts with museums because he had an eagle eye given his legal art
training and made sure I didn’t give away rights that I shouldn’t give away at
the time when the book was first published. [laughter]
Fryberger: How about a few words about the Humanities Center? Just how it brings
together different parts of the campus and do many other universities have
an equivalent of the Humanities Center, or did they at the time that you were
there?
Corn: [01:57:56] Well, the Stanford Humanities Center has a wonderful history.
Yes, other universities have humanities centers but they are usually not as
large and as vital a part of the community as the Stanford Humanities Center
has become. These centers tend to have a couple of properties in common.
One is that they are focused on the humanities. Two, that they bring in
scholars from outside the university and mix them with inside resident
faculty. And three, these centers are often given the job as our Humanities
Center has taken on, of doing major programming in the humanities. The
Stanford Humanities Center organizes the presidential lectures and other
endowed lectures that bring leading humanists to the campus, sometimes for
a whole week. [01:58:50] The Humanities Center organizes that week and
makes sure that many people from across the campus are involved in the
visit and so on. I was around for the birth of the Humanities Center in 1982.
I was not around for the faculty activism that made it come into being. I’ve

70

heard the story many, many times of how humanists gathered together. I
gather they had something of a caucus.
[01:59:22] And when Don Kennedy became president, knowing that the
humanists were always griping about their lack of parity with the sciences, he
said to a few of them, well what would make a difference to your lives? The
conversation brought about the founding of the Stanford Humanities Center.
In 1982, Ian Watt from the English department was appointed the founding
director. And the Humanities Center was first based in the lounge of the
English department. I was in the first class of fellows, which was very small. .
[02:00:20] There were like five of us from the university and maybe four or
five from outside the university and we didn’t have our own offices at that
point. In fact, I wrote the Grant Wood catalogue that I just referred to
during my year at the Humanities Center though I wrote most of it at home.
It was a very important year for me. And Ian was an inspired leader. We
would have wonderful conversations across disciplines and that’s one of the
things that are indigenous to humanities centers. They’re never dedicated to
one discipline or one field of study over any other...they are meant to bring
people together who can talk across the boundaries of their disciplines. The
premise is that your work will be richer for that conversation.
[02:01:07] That you’ll be sharing your research with lots of people from other
areas and as a consequence will create a more broadminded study. I think
that’s not only theory, but it works well in practice.
Fryberger: Now that it’s grown so much...

71

Corn: [02:01:27] It’s really grown a lot. The second director was Bliss Carnochan
and then I was invited to be the third director. They did a search, a campus
search that is, and I was a reluctant candidate because I had just started to
chair the art department. And I thought there was a lot of work to do there.
I was working closely with Mona Duggan, who was at that time one of the
two administrators in the department. Liz Martin was the other. And we
were trying to invent new art history programs, new lectures, new
symposiums and so on that we could bring to campus. And I was having a
pretty good time of it. I was also running the museum at that point. So my
life was full. But when the provost invited me to be the next director of the
Humanities Center, I considered it, knowing that it was time for maybe a
female voice, for a representative from a small department, and for
somebody outside the English department.
[02:02:34] The provost wanted to make sure that this Humanities Center
didn’t simply become an arm of the English department. So after much
thought I decided to do it, but I needed a year off to finish something. So
Herbert Lindenberger became a one-year interim appointment. And then I
came in, from 1992 to 1995. The Humanities Center was then housed in
Mariposa House, Rogers House, and the Annex as it was called, on Campus
Drive. We had these three old houses up behind the law school and the
music department.
[02:03:23] And our fellows had grown to--oh gosh, I’ve got to think--at least
fifteen to twenty fellows in residence at any one time. They were mostly
nine-month appointments and included external faculty, internal faculty, and

72

advanced graduate students. One of the innovative components of our
Humanities Center is that we have graduate student fellow writing
dissertations from the humanities department; it’s very competitive to get
one of those fellowships. But it’s a precious and very special award in that
students get an office, colleagues, and a place to try out their scholarship on
senior people. It’s fantastic. I loved all that intergenerational mixing up of
fellows but I didn’t invent any of it.
[02:04:11] It was in place when I arrived but what was growing was our
facilities and our programming. We had just acquired the Annex, so we had
better spaces for presenting programs and we were growing
programmatically. We were doing more things on campus sponsored by the
Stanford Humanities Center. During the year that Herbie Lindenberger was
in place, Charlie Junkerman was the associate director. He actually should
have been called the co-director, because he did so much of the hard work.
Charlie was a full time administrator of the Stanford Humanities Center. And
there were three other staff members that were full time. We had a
receptionist, someone who did the finances, and then we had Susan Sebbard
who is still there, who had an assortment of jobs running the fellowship
program and programmatic events. (Today, the staffing is something like
nine to twelve people)
[02:05:10] The idea had come along to get John Cage to come to campus for
one of our weeklong programs. Usually such a person came in and gave three
lectures over the course of a week and a couple of lunchtime discussions and
so on. But the idea was to bring John Cage here and in fact do John Cageian

73

things. That happened in the interim year (January 1992) before my tenure at
the center but I participated in it and it is probably one of the greatest weeks
of Stanford’s artistic life. [Laughter]
Fryberger: I agree.
Corn: [02:05:49] What did you do for it? Because the whole campus got involved...
Fryberger: The whole campus did get involved. Well, Wanda, you asked me to do a
related exhibition. John Cage had been coming to Crown Point Press almost
annually for many, many years, making prints. And, of course, he did
unorthodox things. And one of the things he did was he would light a fire
on the press bed and the prints would come out smoked and burnt and
charred and whatever. But the people who worked at the press really loved
him. One of the things I came away with...we went to almost all the events
at the John Cage celebration on campus...was what an outpouring of love
there was for this man. I mean, he was so sweet, people would bring bags of
mushrooms for him. I mean, you know it was very touching in a very human
way. And then one of the most absurd things happened was he was giving a
lecture in the music building, this was their big lecture hall I guess. You
could go into some of the different studios, which we did, but then I went in
the lecture hall and there he was sitting at a table, speaking or reading but
there was no microphone that worked and I thought that was all part of it. I
thought it was intentional. [Laughter] I later found out it wasn’t intentional
at all but somehow it seemed just right.
Corn: [02:07:10] We probably should say for the record that there were Cage events
all week long.

74

Fryberger: Yes, I went to a Merce Cunningham symposium, but I also went to the
concert where the violin plays the same note for one minute forty seconds or
whatever, and another one where ice is dropped.
Corn: [02:07:34] Ice melts and makes a noise as it melts and drips into water and so
the beautiful sound of something dripping...
Fryberger: And then it lands on strings.
Corn: [02:07:44] Yes
Fryberger: ...and so you get plink, but actually for a long time not much happened
because the ice wasn’t melting and so you sat there...
Corn: [02:07:51] ...for a long time.
Fryberger: ...in silence, waiting for the first drop. [Laughter]
Corn: [02:07:55] That’s right, I’d forgotten that and then the musi-circus as it’s
called. And he had done one of these before. This was a kind of a
happening. I loved every minute of it and helped make sure the week went
smoothly but Charlie did the hard work of coordination. For the musicircus, we invited not just the campus but anybody who wanted to make
music across the Bay Area could apply for a room and time slot. I think
there was something like eighty different events and they took place...was it
in Braun? Did we have Braun by then?
Fryberger: Yes.
Corn: [02:08:48] Every single studio in Braun had something going on in it at the
same time. The musi-circus started like at eight o’ clock at night and it went
all night long, didn’t it? Or at least to three in the morning or something like
that?

75

Fryberger: We didn’t stay that late, but we certainly got a sense that there were people
from all over. We kept saying these do not look like Stanford students.
[Laughter]
Corn: [02:09:14] Every room had different music going on in it and sometimes the
doors were shut and sometimes the doors were open. So you could stand in
the building and hear this cacophony of everything from soloists to rock
bands to people that were just tingling little meditation bells. It was the
music of the world all pulled together in this little island of noise that night.
It was probably one of the great art experiences I’ve ever had in my life. And
then because Cage was on a macrobiotic diet, we had to hire a macrobiotic
cook to work with him for the week.
[02:10:04] He was very modest and didn’t want any fuss made about him, but
while we were eating our buffets of the usual California meats and
vegetables, there’d be a cook in the kitchen mixing up something that would
work for his needs. Anyway, that was a great moment. And then I must say
he opened up the thinking at the Humanities Center that maybe we could get
beyond academics and we could do other things with artists. Another special
occasion was when we invited Spalding Gray to come for a week of activities.
He did improv and story-telling classes with the drama department and
performed one of his monologues in progress for the public.
[02:10:55] I don’t think it was Monster in a Box but Gray’s Anatomy. I
think Monster had already been made into a film and had alerted a national
audience to his performances in New York City. He was a great comedian,
monologist, and self-psychoanalyst. He was marvelous with students. He

76

performed at Dinkelspiel, I think, maybe two different times over the course
of the week. And that brought in the larger community, which was another
thing we were doing at the Humanities Center during my term.
[02:11:41] We were doing outreach. We were trying not to be this little
provincial center of people just doing their scholarship but to try to show
other people what the humanities were and to demonstrate the best of the
humanities for larger audiences. To that end, I commissioned a couple of
filmmakers from Stanford’s documentary film program to make a film about
our activities at the center, hoping that that might help us raise money. I was
fundraising a great deal. I learned my fundraising skills at the Humanities
Center. Bliss Carnochan was one of my mentors because he had started
raising money for SHC.
[02:12:27] I don’t think Ian Watt had to raise money but Bliss knew that the
only way we could get bigger and better was to nurture friends of the center
and potential donors. I saw development work as part of my job definition
and worked hard to inform people about what we were about at the
Humanities Center. At the time, people didn’t know what a Humanities
Center was. It’s still something that staffers have to describe over and over
again. I continue to work for the Stanford Humanities Center. I’m doing
two presentations this year. I gave one in New York and I’m going to give
one in a few weeks in San Francisco, to help SHC nurture alumni and friends
across the country.

77

[02:13:12] What I do is show people what my humanistic scholarship looks
like and the degree to which it is interdisciplinary and broad reaching, an
example of the kind of work that we encourage at the Humanities Center.
One other humanist that I worked hard to bring to campus was Susan
Sontag. She was not easy to persuade to come to campus for a week of her
very busy life.
[02:13:49] However, she loved California and I had gotten to know her a
little bit at Mills College because she had come for a couple of days there. So
I knew we had California in our favor, and I worked for a couple of years to
get her to campus. The visit didn’t happen until one year after I left as
director. It was under Keith Baker who was my successor that she came for
her weeklong stay. But it was one that I remember working very hard to
deliver.
It was during Keith’s tenure as director, not mine, that he and Charlie had to
make the big decision to give up the three old houses that our humanities
fellows just loved.
[02:14:34] At the end of the year, the evaluations were always “don’t give up
these wonderful domestic settings.” It’s so comfortable to work here. Even
having three houses had something going for it because people could leave
their offices and walk to Mariposa House where we had lunch every day
together. But Keith made the decision and I think he made the right decision
that when the former alumni office came open in the middle of campus, right
in the center of humanistic activity, he took it over and gave up the houses
that now belong to other departments on campus.

78

Fryberger: Continuing outreach, you’ve been very active with Stanford alumni tours. In
fact, you received the Richard Lyman Award for faculty volunteer service at
one point and I think you’re still giving tours. Can you just say one or two
words about that?
Corn: [02:15:27] Yes, quick words because this has been a part of a lot of faculty
lives. We have been faculty for more than fifteen Travel-Study tours. My
first tour, which was just not mine, but Joe Corn and Wanda Corn’s first
tour, was in ’87. Was that the bicentennial year? I should know, I think it
is...the bicentennial of the constitution. Travel-Study was doing a cruise on
the inter-coastal waterways from Washington DC to New York with a
considerable amount of time around Philadelphia because of the bicentennial
year. And we went around the Statue of Liberty and under the Brooklyn
Bridge, or at least I think I arranged for the ship to go under the Brooklyn
Bridge because that’s always a special interest of mine.
[02:16:26] In any case, Joe and I were persuaded to lead our first Stanford
alumni tour by Peter Voll, who was the brilliant entrepreneurial head of
Travel-Study in those years. We weren’t sure quite what we were getting into
and wondered if we had enough expertise to cover all the stops on the tour,
which ranged from politics to history to art history and architecture. So we
had a little bit of trepidation going into this, but we came away having had
the time of our lives. The tour was beautifully planned and we enjoyed
sharing our knowledge with the people who travel on these tours who often
are West Coast based.

79

[02:17:24] It was great fun to show off the East Coast, because we were
raised and schooled in the east and know more of its history than we do of
the West Coast. It was really a delight to share with people what we saw on
the tour. That first tour ended in Boston. I remember that we stopped at
Nantucket and took a bus trip so we could all walk out to the dunes and see
some characteristic Cape Cod beaches and low growth. I remember vividly
somebody asking us to point out poison ivy and realized that maybe we had
more expertise than we thought. [laughter] Poison ivy is not something you
see on the West Coast but something that we certainly had grown up with on
the East Coast.
[02:18:19] So we’ve continued ever since then to lead travel study tours--and
we also did a couple of tours for the Committee for Art, which I know
Lorenz and Al Elsen had done.
[02:18:35] We worked a lot with Peter Voll on the Delta Queen. The Delta
Queen was a wonderful old paddle wheeler and we did five different tours
doing inter waterways...rivers basically, the Ohio River, Tennessee River,
upper Mississippi, lower Mississippi. Once we had done all the trips that the
Delta Queen did, we decided to call it to a halt and not repeat any. But we
loved that steam ship...when the piano player sat down at the steam organ at
every stop, steam came out of the organ pipes in different colors. And of
course we could use our strengths in American art and literature and history
to good advantage throughout those trips. So those cruises were very
special.

80

[02:19:33] We did a couple of tours in Europe and now we’re doing ones on
the East Coast. We’ve done two tours of the Hudson River in autumn,
looking at fall on the Hudson River, not to mention the Hudson River
School painters that we look at and visit their homes. And next year we’re
inaugurating a tour that does New England and goes from upper Maine to
Providence, Rhode Island. And I’ve done trips to Taos in New Mexico and
I’ve also done trips to Europe when we toured places I had expertise in.
This year we’re going to Russia in July. And that will be a first. I am
brushing up on my history of Russian art as we speak, because this is
something I’ve long wanted to do and the trip features the arts of Russia.
[02:20:25] We’re going during white nights, the time during the summer in
Russia when the darkness never comes, except for a couple of hours. So
we’ll see ballet, opera and, of course, we’ll be going to the great Russian
museums in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
Fryberger: Sounds great. Let’s just close with that you knew about the development of
SiCa. Were you involved in...it must have taken a while to grow and you
certainly were involved in the options discussed, where to move the art
department and the choice of moving the art department next door to the
museum.
Corn: [02:21:10] Yes, well this is a good place to end because it’s also where I end
in a certain way. [Laughter] These projects in the last few years since I
retired have moved much further along. But I was at Stanford when the ideas
behind both of them were born.
Fryberger: I guess we should explain what SiCa is.

81

Corn: [02:21:32] It’s the Stanford Initiative for Creativity in the Arts. And I was on
campus for its birth. This was an initiative of President Hennessy who, when
he took over the presidency, was left with some unfinished business from the
presidency of Gerhard Casper. We had known as a department, or at least I
had known as a senior member of the department, that Gerhard Casper had
hoped to enlarge the art department and give it a better building because we
had run out of space. And our art studios are no longer up to standards for
safety and toxicity.
[02:22:31] We know so much more today about the science of paint and
printmaking and sculpture, and our studios are woefully deficient in being
safe places to work. There’s that and then we art historians don’t have the
kind of classrooms we need. The nature of our classes has changed. We
don’t need the big auditorium of Annenberg as much as we need more
medium size classrooms that we don’t have. And we certainly need another
seminar room. We only have one in Cummings. So there began to be
pressing needs for a bigger and better building. The idea was that this could
happen but, of course, we had to find the funding for it. That funding was
helped when the Hoover Institution that had always eyed our building with
some desire to acquire it offered to “buy” Cummings and pay to have us
move elsewhere.
[02:23:38] This was the start of a campaign for a new art building. The place
the administration had in mind was behind the museum where there was
once a museum wing, presently a low level, one-story building that has not

82

been used since ’89. It was evacuated after the earthquake and offered a
footprint on which to build.
[02:24:26] That decision was a bit of a hurdle...with good reason. Many of
my colleagues were not anxious to leave campus central, near the libraries
and the quad. In any case, the decision was made to go there long before the
school had raised any money and decided to go forward. We had endless
meetings about a new building but made very little progress because the
administration never made the building a first priority. Should I just quickly
say SiCa, a little bit?
Fryberger: Yes.
Corn: [02:24:57] I’ll quickly add that SiCa became one of the ways in which the
building campaign was worked into a broader fabric of support for the arts.
As we all sat around the table with representatives from dance and music and
drama and art, it became clear that every single one of these departments had
needs, either building needs or serious curricular needs that were not moving
forward. So out of a long set of discussions came this initiative that would
not just be our initiative, that is, the art and art history department, but a
much more broadly based one serving all the arts and all the students. And it
would be an initiative to broaden the presence of the arts on campus, to get
the arts outside of the departments, and to energize the campus with
programming that would include taking students to great performances in
San Francisco, that would have performances happening in the dorms, and
so on.

83

[02:25:59] I actually don’t know how SiCa is doing but that was the start of
something new. It was a big, bold, creative plan and along with it, of course,
came a lot of fundraising. I think the initiative has done fairly well. It’s
going to go under new leadership in a moment, I think. It’s about ready to
go through some transitions. But one of the things that has finally happened
is that a major gift by Burt and Deedee McMurtry will make it possible for
the building finally to go forward. The recession has hurt, and there’s been
yet one more lag. I used to tell the deans that I’ll be retired before this
building is built and I meant that as a joke.
[02:26:46] It was very frustrating. I must have worked on plans for at least
ten years, plans that would then be scrapped and new plans would come
along. And new architects, and new planners, and oh my goodness, I can’t
tell you how many permutations and how many emergency meetings we were
called to, that we all had to be there in twenty-four hours because this
decision had to be made and then nothing ever materialized. It just never
happened for a whole bunch of reasons. And the recession hasn’t helped
any. But finally I gather we’re up and running. An architect has been chosen
and I’ve been told that there are plans for the building to be done rather
quickly, in the next couple of years, and the move-in date that’s been targeted
is the fall of 2014.
[02:27:29] Now we have been helped by the fact that Hoover would like our
building as soon as possible. So God bless the Hoover for giving us enough
money to get this whole thing moving along and then pressing for a
timetable because the longer we stay in our building, you know, the less long

84

they have to do whatever they’re going to do with it. And it’s never been
clear what Hoover is going to do with Cummings. By the time anyone might
read this interview, it probably will have been decided. But it’s never been
clear whether they’re going to raze Cummings and start all over again, or use
it and connect it to their own buildings.
Fryberger: Wanda, thank you so much. This has been a wonderful review of many years
at Stanford and of your indomitable enthusiasm and energy and your
consensus building. You’ve played a major role at Stanford and I’ve been
delighted to share some of this with you, so thank you.
Corn: [02:28:25] Now before you turn that off, Betsy, I just have to say to members
of the Historical Society that I think they are doing a wonderful job of
rescuing history that will be lost as we all get older and move onto other
things or away or die. I do hope that the Historical Society will also make it
possible to do interviews like this with the museum curators, like you and
Carol Osborne particularly. But then there’s another generation, or a
younger group that are coming along and they soon will be retiring. But I do
hope that the early history of the museum will be salvaged and saved this way
because it’s a fascinating and complex history, right?
[02:29:06] It goes from a museum that just was completely forgotten by the
university, then was started up again by the community in the fifties. People
don’t know that history. And then along comes Lorenz Eitner and makes it
one of his pet projects. So you and Carol Osborne should definitely be
tapped for interviews. Maybe I should offer to do the interviewer part of

85

those, but I hope that somebody will do those histories because they’re very
important to Stanford’s art program.
Fryberger:

I agree, but anyway Wanda, this has been wonderful. Thank you again so
much.
