Introduction
This oral history was conducted by the Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program, in
collaboration with the Stanford University Archives. The program is under the direction of
the Oral History Committee of the Stanford Historical Society.
The Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program furthers the Society’s mission “to
foster and support the documentation, study, publication, dissemination, and preservation of
the history of the Leland Stanford Junior University.” The program explores the institutional
history of the University, with an emphasis on the transformative post-WWII period,
through interviews with leading faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and others. The interview
recordings and transcripts provide valuable additions to the existing collection of written and
photographic materials in the Stanford University Archives.
Oral history is not a final, verified, or complete narrative of events. It is a unique, reflective,
spoken account, offered by the interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it may be
deeply personal. Each oral history is a reflection of the past as the interviewee remembers
and recounts it. But memory and meaning vary from person to person; others may recall
events differently. Used as primary source material, any one oral history will be compared
with and evaluated in light of other evidence, such as contemporary texts and other oral
histories, in arriving at an interpretation of the past. Although the interviewees have a past or
current connection with Stanford University, they are not speaking as representatives of the
University.
Each transcript is edited by program staff and by the interviewee for grammar, syntax, and
occasional inaccuracies and to aid in overall clarity and readability, while maintaining the
substantive content of the interview as well as the interviewee’s voice. As a result of this
editing process, the transcript does not match the recording verbatim. In the rare case that a
substantive deletion has been made, this is indicated at the relevant place on the transcript.
Any substantive additions are noted in brackets or by footnote.

Abstract
Myra Strober is Professor of Education, Emerita at the Stanford Graduate School of
Education and Professor of Economics (by courtesy) at the Stanford Graduate School of
Business. Her research and consulting focus on gender issues in the workplace, the
economics of work and family, and multidisciplinarity in higher education. Her two-part
interview begins with her early years in Brooklyn, New York, where her interest in
economics formed. Strober recalls her undergraduate education at the School of Industrial
and Labor Relations at Cornell University, her master’s program at Tufts University, and her
doctoral studies at MIT, where she was one of only two women in her class. She relates how
she eventually made her way to California, teaching as a lecturer at the University of
California at Berkeley before taking an assistant professorship at the Stanford Graduate
School of Business.
Strober discusses her initial experiences teaching on the virtually all-male faculty at the
Business School, her attempt to secure tenure there, and how she became a tenured faculty
member at the School of Education. She recounts the events that led to the creation of the
Center for Research on Women at the university and how she became its founding director.
She discusses fundraising for the center and the lecture series that attracted overflowing
crowds from the campus and neighboring areas. In addition, she discusses her service on the
Committee on Recruitment and Retention of Women Faculty at Stanford and her experience
as a sexual harassment advisor counselling female faculty members. She shares her
perspectives on the challenges facing women in academia, such as a low percentage of
women on the tenured faculty, salary disparity, and a lack of support.
Strober also relates the story of how Stanford successfully competed to host and edit the
preeminent women’s studies journal, Signs and its impact on the faculty and students
involved. She discusses her research on occupational segregation, including her theory of
how the relative attractiveness of occupations impacted work opportunities for women, and
her research on childcare. Strober concludes with an assessment of some of the ways
Stanford has changed over time.

VY LUU

INTERVIEWEE:

MYRA H. STROBER

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MAY 6, 2014

Luu: This is Vy Luu. It is May 6, 2014. I’m interviewing Myra Strober on behalf of
the Stanford Historical Society for the Pioneering Women Project. We are
conducting the interview in Myra’s home.
Myra, to start off, can we talk about where you were born and where
you grew up?
Strober: [00:00:17] Sure. And thank you for doing this interview.
Luu: Of course.
Strober: [00:00:22] I was born in Brooklyn, New York, and spent my childhood there.
Luu: Can you tell me about your family?
Strober: [00:00:36] My parents, Julius and Reggie [Regina] Hoffenberg, were also born
in New York. They were in their mid-thirties at the time I was born, and my
sister, Alice Amsden, was born two years later. Her name was not Amsden
when she was born; she was Alice Hoffenberg.
My mother was the eldest of seven children, and we were very close
to my mother’s family. I had about twelve cousins, all of whom were younger
than I, and multiple aunts and uncles. My father had two brothers, and they
were both married as well. I had a very large and very loving family, and we

13

used to get together quite frequently, so there were lots of people to love and
lots of people to love me.
Luu: Can you tell me about your family’s values and how these values influenced
you?
Strober: [00:01:48] My mother’s father was an observant Orthodox Jew, and although
none of his children or grandchildren were observant, we all participated, out
of respect for him, in multiple Jewish occasions every year. We celebrated all
the Jewish holidays and we went to his synagogue on the High Holidays. My
grandmother was a wonderful cook and, along with her sister, used to make
dinners for thirty people for these occasions.
Luu: Wow.
Strober: [00:02:34] They were fabulously delicious dinners. I don’t know how they did
it because my grandmother and her sister were in their mid-seventies at that
time, but they had an enormous amount of energy, and they entertained and
we had a great time.
The values that I learned were Jewish values about the importance of
kindness to other people. My grandfather always told me that we all had a
piece of God in us and therefore we needed to be kind to everyone we met
because they had the same piece of God that we had.
Luu: Can you tell me about your early interests? What do you remember doing
with your time while you were growing up?
Strober: [00:03:26] I used to love to read. Every spring when the weather got nice, my
mother would threaten to take away my books if I didn’t go out and play
because my preference was to just stay in the house and read. [laughter] So

14

today when I see kids with video games, who have the same passion for their
video games as I had for my books, I’m probably one of the few adults who
is very sympathetic to their interests.
But I also was very interested in economics from an early age because
my father was always afraid of losing his job. My father worked for his
cousin in the men’s clothing industry, a very volatile industry where
companies go bankrupt frequently, and he was always afraid of losing his job.
My mother always worked too. She was an elementary school secretary. But
my father’s fear of losing his job always made me wonder how the economy
worked, how people got jobs, and how they lost jobs, and so very early on I
was curious about that.
Luu: What expectations did you have for yourself in terms of a career?
Strober: [00:04:51] Well, my mother never called herself a feminist, but she certainly
was a feminist, and she had expectations for both me and my sister. She
always said, “Marriage is not the be-all and the end-all of life,” and you have
to be able to support yourself in what she used to call “a rainy day,” by which
she meant in case your husband died. Divorce was very uncommon then, so
she wasn’t worried about divorce, but she was worried about death.
So both my sister and I grew up expecting to have careers. The kind
of career that I expected to have was as a teacher--either an elementary
school or high school teacher. My mother had always wanted to be a teacher
and that dream never came true for her, so she always thought that if I could
be a teacher, it would be extremely fulfilling, not only for me but also for her.
Luu: And you wanted to be a teacher as well?

15

Strober: [00:06:01] Oh, I thought being a teacher would be wonderful because, as I
said, I loved books, so the idea that I could spend my life helping other
people to love books seemed terrific.
Luu: Did you encounter the Women’s Movement while you were growing up?
Strober: [00:06:18] No, I never encountered the Women’s Movement while I was
growing up. The only Women’s Movement I knew was my mother. [laughter]
My mother could have been the president of General Motors. She was very
organized and very smart, and she was a force of nature.
In 1963, Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique, and that
generally symbolizes the beginning of the second wave of feminism, while
the first wave was with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony and
the fight for suffrage. By the way, I’d never heard of Elizabeth Cady Stanton
when I was young. I had heard of Susan B. Anthony. But I had no
information about the Women’s Movement when I was growing up, and,
really, the second wave didn’t get started until the late sixties, even though
Betty Friedan’s book came out in 1963. I graduated from Cornell in 1962, so
I was totally unacquainted with the Women’s Movement when I was in
college.
Luu: How did you end up attending Cornell?
Strober: [00:07:47] I had to bargain with my parents to attend Cornell. My father had
never gone to college. My mother went to college at night at the City College
of New York and worked during the day. For them the idea that I could go
to college full-time during the day and not work was a miracle, and they
thought I should be very grateful for that. But, of course, I wasn’t. [laughter]

16

I wanted to go to a great college, and I didn’t think Brooklyn College was a
great college, and I told them that. I bargained with them to let me apply to
out-of-town colleges, and they finally gave in.
One of my neighbors told me about the School of Industrial and
Labor Relations (ILR) at Cornell, and when I got their materials, I thought,
“Wow! This program has been tailor-made for me.” Every course that was in
the catalog was one that I wanted to take, and I thought, “I’ll really learn
about working with people and how the economy works.” I was very excited.
My favorite course at Cornell was “Bus Riding 101.” That’s what we
called it. That’s not what it was called in the catalog. For this course, our class
went to a different factory every week. We went to a steel mill in Syracuse.
We went to a coal mine in Pennsylvania. We went to the IBM factory, to the
Corning Glass factory. At all of those places we were able to talk to workers
and to management, and we had to write a report each week on our trip. I
got a very good sense of what the work world was like.
I remember years later when I was teaching a course on labor
relations at the Stanford Business School, and I was talking about the
grievance procedure. We were studying a case in a chemical factory where a
worker had filed a grievance because the foreman wouldn’t let him leave to
go to the bathroom, and one of my students said that he was fed up with this
case, that he didn’t come to Business School to spend his time talking about
people who couldn’t go to the bathroom. Something clicked in my head, and
I thought, “I bet this guy has never been in a factory.” So I asked the whole

17

class--there must have been about sixty students, “How many of you have
ever been inside a factory?” Not a single one had.
I said, “OK, class dismissed,” and I went home, made some phone
calls, and got the class a tour of the Chevrolet plant in Fremont. My students
got to see what the inside of a factory was like, what a worker’s life was like,
and then we came back and discussed the case. Finally my student
understood why it might be important to have a union and to file a grievance
when you worked in that situation and were prohibited from going to the
bathroom.
Luu: Just going back a little bit here. Was it normal for women to go to college
during the time that you attended Cornell?
Strober: [00:11:35] Well, it was much less normal for anyone to go to college. About 25
percent of high school graduates went on to college. My high school had
about 1,000 graduates, so about 250 of us went to college, and certainly the
percentage of men going to college was much higher than the percentage of
women. At ILR, there were sixty students in my class, and only fifteen of us
were women. It was very unusual to be a woman in ILR, and at Cornell as a
whole, about 25 percent of the students were women.
Luu: Were you taught by any female faculty members?
Strober: [00:12:23] I had one woman faculty member in my entire career at Cornell.
Her name was Alice Cook, and she taught a class on labor union history. She
had been in the Labor Movement and she was really a spunky woman. I
made contact with her later on after she’d retired from Cornell because she
became interested in women after the Women’s Movement started. We had

18

many, many conversations together. But she was the only woman faculty
member I had at Cornell, and when I went to graduate school, I never had a
single female professor.
Luu: What led you to pursue graduate school?
Strober: [00:13:17] Well, my senior year, the dean of students at ILR called me in, said
that several faculty members had recommended me for a Woodrow Wilson
Fellowship, and asked me if I had considered graduate school. I said, no, I
was going to be a high school teacher and wasn’t interested.
Then I told Sam Strober, the man that I ultimately married about
this, and he said, “You should go to graduate school. Instead of being a high
school teacher, you’ll be a college teacher.” Neither one of us had any idea
that being a high school teacher and being a college teacher were two
different universes.
So I went back to the dean and told him I was interested. I never got
the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, but I did apply to graduate school, and I
was accepted at Tufts for the master’s program in economics. Then I went to
MIT for the PhD in economics. If that dean hadn’t called me in, I doubt that
I would have gotten a PhD.
Luu: Tell me more about your experiences at Tufts and MIT.
Strober: [00:14:53] Well, Tufts was a wonderful little program. There were only five of
us in the economics master’s program. We had terrific faculty members. I did
my dissertation with Frank Holzman on Soviet trade unions. I thought I
might become a scholar of Soviet economics because I was very interested in
that, but I couldn’t manage to learn enough Russian, and so my dissertation

19

was based on secondary sources in English. Interestingly enough, I had a lot
of sources from the CIA, which was doing a lot of work on the Soviet
Union.
Then at MIT, I was definitely interested in labor economics. I was
one of only two women in my cohort of 30 students. And in the class above
me and the class below me, there were also only one or two women. I was
very lonely there. I was one of the few people who was married already, there
were few women students, and no women faculty, and the secretaries really
were not interested in talking to me.
Luu: Who did you seek out for advising or guidance then?
Strober: [00:16:42] Well, my faculty were great. Charlie [Charles] Myers was my main
dissertation advisor. He was extremely supportive. Abraham Siegel, who was
also a member of the labor economics group, was also very supportive, and
he ultimately became dean of the Sloan School of Management. So I had lots
of faculty support. I think all the graduate students were treated the same,
including me.
Luu: That’s great. So what did you do after you got your PhD in 1969?
Strober: [00:17:32] I moved away from MIT in 1967 because my husband was going
to work at the NIH, National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland,
and I got a job at the University of Maryland in the Economics Department.
I thought my dissertation would be done by then, but it wasn’t. I had a new
baby, an unfinished thesis, and a new job, so it took me another two years to
finish my thesis. But when I realized I was pregnant with my daughter, I
thought, “Boy, I’d better finish this thesis.” So I did, and when I went back

20

to MIT for my oral [defense], I was as pregnant as I had been when I’d left
two years earlier.
When I finished my third year at the University of Maryland, my
husband finished his service at the NIH and got a residency and then an
assistant professorship at Stanford, so we moved to Stanford. It never
occurred to us to go on the job market together. The way things were then
was that wives followed their husbands, and so he got a job at Stanford, and
I came to the Bay Area with no job. I’d had lots of interviews, but none of
them had materialized into a job.
Then I got a letter from Lloyd Ulman at Berkeley saying that a
position as a lecturer was opening there, and was I interested. Even though
I’d been an assistant professor at Maryland and this was a demotion, I had no
choice, because we had moved to Stanford, and now I was at the mercy of
whoever was going to give me a job. So I took the job at Berkeley as a
lecturer.
Luu: Can you tell me more about your experience as a lecturer at Berkeley?
Strober: [00:20:37] I kept trying to figure out why I was a lecturer and not an assistant
professor. Two of my classmates from MIT were on the faculty at Berkeley,
Tu [Lovell] Jarvis and Richard Sutch, and they were assistant professors. But
the chair of the department told me that I couldn’t be an assistant professor,
that he could never sell that to the department. So I was a lecturer, and that
discrimination really was what got me into feminism. Seeing my classmates,
who had had the same education as I, with regular faculty jobs and not being

21

able to get one myself, I began to do a lot of research on women’s
discriminatory treatment. I discovered Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
I asked at Berkeley if I could teach a course the following year on
women and work. They allowed me to do that, and that was the beginning of
my career. I had come to Berkeley thinking I was going to do work on
unemployment, and now this whole new field that was truly new--there was
nobody in it--was opening up, and I taught my first course at Berkeley on
women and work.
Then that year, Berkeley made me an offer as an assistant professor,
and not long thereafter, Stanford Business School made me an offer as
assistant professor, too, and I think that Stanford—well, I forgot an
important part here. When I got to Berkeley, I found out that not only was I
a lecturer, but basically every woman on the faculty was a lecturer, with rare
exceptions, and that they had all filed a complaint with the Labor
Department against Berkeley the previous year with the Women’s Equity
Action League. It was one of, oh, hundreds of universities that had
complaints filed against them for discriminating against women.
Stanford didn’t want a similar complaint to be filed against them, so
they got their act together and made me an offer. I was the first woman
faculty member at the Business School, and they also hired the first black
man at the Business School, the first Asian American man at the Business
School, and the first Chicano, all the same year. Stanford also hired its first
woman at the Law School and a woman at the School of Engineering. I was
impressed by the power of the law to change institutions.

22

At that same time, September of 1972, Francine Gordon was also
hired at the Business School, and when I got there, I taught my course on
women and work.
Luu: So it was during this time that you began transitioning into studying women
and economics from your experience at Berkeley?
Strober: [00:24:40] Women and work.
Luu: OK, women and work.
Strober: [00:24:45] Yes.
Luu: Why did you choose to come to Stanford rather than accept a position at
Berkeley?
Strober: [00:24:57] Well, I really would have preferred to teach in an economics
department than in a business school, but I was commuting to Berkeley. I
had two little children. In fact, the chair of the department at Berkeley told
me that he couldn’t sell me as an assistant professor to the department because
I had two little children. The commute was OK in the morning, but truly
horrendous in the afternoon. The idea of being only ten minutes away from
my work and having no commute was exceedingly attractive, so I decided to
accept the position at Stanford.
Luu: Can you tell me more about what it was like to be one of the first women
teaching at the Graduate School of Business?
Strober: [00:25:59] It was really awful. Many of my colleagues were hostile. There
were only five women students in the first class. And they had prepared a
slideshow called “What’s a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?” In
some ways it was like MIT, except at MIT, even though I was one of the only

23

women and it was lonely, it was never unfriendly, but at the GSB, some of
the male students were openly rude, saying that they hadn’t paid all this
money to have me as their professor.
Really my salvation was the few women students that were there and
also Francine Gordon, who was my colleague. But she was also having a
tough time. This was her first teaching experience. I had had five years of
teaching experience, so I had that going for me, but as a brand new assistant
professor with all of the sexism, it was really a hard time for her.
Arjay Miller, who was the Dean of the Business School, was a prince.
He was extremely supportive. He had been the CEO of Ford Motor
Company. He was not an academic. Francine and I wanted to create and host
a conference on women in management at the GSB, and he supported that
wholeheartedly. He told us that if we planned the conference, he would
guarantee that his buddies would show up. And he brought them all, all in
suits, and all interested in increasing the number of women in management.
The reason why people were interested in increasing the number of
women in management was because the government was telling corporations
that as government contractors they had to hire women into management
positions. But since business schools had never trained them, there weren’t
very many to choose from. So these managers of major corporations, many
of them high up in their companies, were very interested in figuring out how
to bring women into management.
The Business School began recruiting women students because its
Advisory Council told them that they needed to start training women. They

24

asked Francine and me to help, but after only one year, we didn’t have to
recruit anymore. Once the word was out that the Business School wanted
women students, they flocked to apply. And this was true nationwide, not
just at Stanford. So in just a few short years, the number of women students
in MBA programs really increased enormously.
Luu: Going back a little bit here, can you give me some examples when you say
that your colleagues were hostile in the—
Strober: [00:29:21] Ah! Well, for example they were very annoyed because the faculty
retreat had been held at a men’s club in Portola Valley, the Family Farm,
which is a lovely facility. And now, because there were two women on the
faculty, the poor guys couldn’t have their retreat there, and so they cried like
little babies and said weird things to us like maybe they could smuggle us in
as men.
We went to Arjay Miller and we asked him what we should do about
this, and he said, “Just don’t pay any attention to them. Eventually I’ll figure
out how to get you in there.” By the time he did get us in there, Francine had
left, but a new woman had come to the Business School, Joanne Martin, and
she and I had the great privilege (ahem) of being able to go to the Family
Farm as women in this all-male facility.
Luu: Were you close to anyone else other than Francine?
Strober: [00:30:41] There were some men assistant professors at the Business School
that I worked with, such as Bill [William] Dunkelberg and Charles Weinberg.
We did joint research and that was interesting and good. But most of my
colleagues were outside the Business School.

25

When I first came to Stanford, the administration wanted me to participate in
a press conference in San Francisco, along with Barbara Babcock from the
Law School and Lily Young from the School of Engineering, to tell the
world that Stanford had hired these three women and were doing the right
thing. And so I did.
As a result, there was an article in the Palo Alto newspaper about the
fact that the Business School now had a woman on the faculty, who, of all
things, was studying women. So I was visited by an undergraduate woman,
Cynthia Davis, who said that she and some other women wanted to start a
Center for Research on Women and wanted to know if I could help them.
Then there were two other students in my class who also told me they
wanted to start a Center for Research on Women, Beth Garfield and Susan
Hecht. Beth was running for president, one of the presidents of the ASSU,
Associated Stanford Students, and Susan was a doctoral student at the School
of Education. I introduced them to each other because they both had come
to me independently and said they wanted to start a Center for Research on
Women, and I also got them in touch with Cynthia Davis, who had come to
me earlier.
The students wanted me to spearhead this effort, but I told them that
junior faculty don’t start research centers and that they needed to get senior
faculty on board. So they got Eleanor Maccoby from Psychology and Jim
March and Elizabeth Cohen from the Ed School [Education School], and
Tom Ehrlich from the Law School, and Bill Kays from the School of
Engineering, and we all came together. Eleanor and Jim said that they would

26

be the co-chairs of the policy board for Center of Research on Women. They
wrote a letter to the Ford Foundation asking for a planning grant of $25,000
to start the Center, and they got the planning grant.
But then not much happened, and when we reconvened, Eleanor and
Jim said that they really didn’t have the passion for starting this Center, and
Eleanor said she thought I should start it. [laughs] Jim said that I couldn’t
start it without having some course relief, because I couldn’t be a junior
faculty member, teach a full load, and start a Center for Research on Women.
So he got the idea I should be a university fellow, and he and Eleanor made
that happen. Then I became the chair of the policy board and eventually the
first director of this new Center for Research on Women.
Although I knew that junior faculty are not supposed to start
research centers, this was so exciting, and things at the Business School were
so alienating that I just dove in. I spent my time doing research, teaching my
classes, taking care of two little children, and starting a research center, and,
boy, it was a good thing I had a lot of energy because it was a lot of work.
Luu: What was or wasn’t happening at Stanford in academia that motivated you
and others to start the Center for Research on Women?
Strober: [00:35:57] Well, what wasn’t happening at Stanford wasn’t happening
throughout the world. There were no women in positions of leadership.
Women earned less than men. Women were not permitted to be in jobs that
were lucrative that men had. Elizabeth Cady Stanton said it right. She said,
“Men have monopolized all the good employments, so women are not

27

wanted in law and medicine and academia.” Well, she didn’t say academia,
but that was one of them.
There were very few women on the faculty at Stanford. When I came,
I think 4 percent of the tenure faculty were women. There just weren’t
women here, in law, business, medicine, PhD programs. There were just no
women, or hardly any. So we wanted to understand how all this worked and
how to make it different, and we realized early on that this was a pervasive
and deep problem. I began reading things like Simone de Beauvoir, The
Second Sex, and understanding more and more that it really was going to
require overwhelming change in the society to figure out how to get some
levers to give women an equal shot.
Luu: Going back to your time at the Graduate School of Business, as far as you
know, was your salary typical of other female colleagues? Was it typical of
male colleagues?
Strober: [00:38:11] I think my salary at the Business School was fair and square. I
don’t know for sure, but I think probably it was, because discrimination in
salaries in general was not at the junior level. Men and women tended, if they
were in the same position—that is, assistant professor as opposed to
lecturer—to have similar salaries. But as time went on, the salaries of men
rose much more than the salaries of women, so I think probably after a while
my salary at the Business School was incorrect.
But the problem with Stanford salaries is that there’s no salary
schedule, salaries are not published as they are in public universities, and
there’s a culture here where nobody tells you what other people make, so it’s

28

hard to know how much you’re being underpaid. But we can come back to
that later on when I tell you about what I learned when I was ultimately in a
position to know how much I was being underpaid.
Luu: And you mentioned that some of the first reactions that your students had to
you were kind of hostile. How did that change over the years?
Strober: [00:39:46] Some men were hostile. No woman was ever hostile. The women
were very happy I was there.
Well, do you want to talk about my history at the Business School,
what happened in my tenure case?
Luu: Yes, sure.
Strober: [00:40:01] So I started the Center for Research on Women. We got the grant
from Ford Foundation for $100,000. The university agreed that we could
have permanent status, although, of course, we had to be reviewed
periodically, but the Center was established and I was the director. Then I
felt I needed to go back to the Business School full-time because I was
coming up for tenure and promotion, so Diane Middlebrook and Anne
Miner became co-directors of the Center for Research on Women. I went
back to the Business School full-time. And by then, things had changed
somewhat. I was older. I was more established. There were more women
students. The men were used to having a woman professor. So there was no
more overt hostility of the sort there had been before.
But then I came up for tenure and I was turned down. There was just
no way those men faculty were going to let me into their club. It was one
thing to have a woman assistant professor, but to have a tenured member of

29

the faculty who was a woman? They were not going to do that. So they
turned me down. My husband wanted to stay here--he didn’t want to go on
the job market--so I pretty much thought I was going to have to leave
academia and work for a bank or a corporation.
But David Tyack and Artie [Arthur] Bienenstock went to the dean of
the School of Education and said they thought that the Business School had
made a mistake and that I should be considered for a tenured position at the
School of Education. I had worked with David Tyack for several years
already, doing a project with him on how teaching became a woman’s
occupation, so he knew my work, and he had introduced me to two
economists at the Ed School, Martin Carnoy and Hank [Henry] Levin, and
we got along really well. And Elizabeth Cohen knew my work from the
Center for Research on Women.
So when the dean of the Ed School, Art [Arthur] Coladarci, talked to
all these faculty members, they said, yes, they thought it was a good idea for
me to be considered at the Ed School. And Artie Bienenstock, who was the
vice provost for faculty affairs, promised the Ed School that the university
would pick up a half slot for me, and my other half-time job could be at the
Center for Research on Women, so I’d have a full-time job, and I could be
tenured at the Ed School.
So I came up for tenure for the second time, and this time it went
through. The Ed School faculty voted to give me tenure. But when my case
went to the University Advisory Board, they said no. They said, “How could
one person come up in the same year at the Business School and the Ed

30

School and while one says no, the other says yes? We’re not going to approve
this.” So they turned it down.
Art Coladarci left at the end of the academic year, and the new dean,
Mike Atkin, called me and asked, “Who are you? Your papers are all over my
desk. What’s going on with you?” When we met, he listened to my whole
story and said, “We have to start this all over again. You have to come up for
tenure again.”
The third time turned out to be the charm. But my colleagues from
all over the country who were writing letters of reference thought Stanford
had lost its mind, having one person come up for tenure three times in one
year. But they wrote yet again, and this time the Ed School approved again,
and the new Advisory Board approved. I was in shock. I told my husband I
was never, ever coming up for review again. I was happy to stay as an
associate professor for the rest of my career because this review process was
so awful.
I went back to being the director of the Center for Research on
Women, which was wonderful, and I hired Marilyn Yalom as associate
director, and the center flourished. The center’s going to have its fortieth
anniversary this fall, 2014, because it was in 1974 that we got the Ford grant
and [the center] was approved by the university.
I was also half-time at the Ed School. I loved being at the Ed School.
I had wonderful students, doctoral students really for the first time. Well, I’d
had one at Berkeley, but I was not the chair of her committee. And I had
supportive colleagues. No feelings of alienation.

31

It was just amazing to me that three hundred yards from the Business
School was this other entity that was so totally different. I had a wonderful
career at the Ed School. I loved my classes. I did some research on teaching.
I did some work on childcare. I did some work on the teaching of
economics. I did some work on how economics was taught in high schools.
And I continued all my work on occupational segregation, how teaching
became a women’s occupation, how bank telling became a women’s
occupation.
I did a study of Stanford graduates, and a doctoral student of mine,
Agnes Chan, did a study on the graduates at Tokyo University, both of us
looking at the differences in the careers of the women and men ten years out.
Then Agnes and I wrote a book together comparing the graduates of
Stanford and the graduates of Tokyo University and how the sex differences
were different in the two countries.
Luu: What are some of the classes that you taught at the School of Education?
Strober: [00:48:57] I taught a class on the economics of education and one on the
economics of higher education. I taught one on gender and education. I
taught a class on work and family, which always had a lot of undergraduates
and was cross-listed with Feminist Studies.
I was struck every year by the students in my economics of education
class, master’s and doctoral students who had majored in a variety of subjects
as undergraduates and so had differing quantitative backgrounds. Before I
could teach the economics of education, I had to teach basic economics for a
couple of lectures. I would do that first by simply talking about the economic

32

principles, then I would put graphs on the board, and finally I would put
equations up. And every year the same thing happened: the students with
quantitative backgrounds would say to me at the end of class, “Why do you
drone on and on using only words? As soon as you put the graphs on the
board or, better still, the equations, I know exactly what you’re talking
about.” And then right behind them would be the students with English
majors and anthropology majors, who would say exactly the opposite: “I
understand everything you say, but as soon as you put the graphs and the
equations up, I don’t know what you’re talking about anymore. Is it OK that
I just understand economics in English?”
So I thought, well, this is a really interesting question.
[00:51:13] I talked to one of my colleagues at the Ed School, Jim
[James] Greeno, who was a cognitive psychologist, and I said to him, “I
understand economics verbally, graphically and mathematically. Do these
students who understand it only verbally or only mathematically all
understand the same thing or do they each understand something different?”
“Well, the best way to answer that,” he said, “is to have your teaching
assistant videotape your students discussing a very simple economics
problem that you create, and then jointly graph the solution to the problem,
talking all the while about what they are doing.”
We did this, and I watched the videotapes. I was shocked, and after a
while, I could only watch the tapes after having a glass of wine, because I
learned that if these students couldn’t understand economics both in English
and with graphs, it was clear that they didn’t understand it. I was truly

33

chagrined to find out how many of these students could pass exams without
really understanding what they were talking about.
So I wrote an article called “Economics, Lies, and Videotapes,” and
when some of my colleagues in the Economics Department heard about this,
they wanted me to repeat the study with their students, so I did. We got a
group of students who were in Economics I, and we videotaped them
discussing the same problem: If there is a shortage of science teachers in San
Jose, and the San Jose School District increases their salary, what will happen
to the shortage of teachers? It turned out that the students in Econ I couldn’t
answer the question either, and the people in the Economics Department
were really very surprised that they couldn’t.
So then I wrote another article about making and correcting errors in
economics, because what was happening in these sessions was that although
one or more of the students would understand the correct solution to the
problem, the students who didn’t understand it were able to take the whole
group off in entirely the wrong direction. Then, after an hour or so, one of
the students who did understand it would be able to bring them back. The
article was about how this correction process took place.
I got very interested in how students understand economics, and I
changed my teaching radically. Instead of aiming for coverage, I aimed for
understanding, and I would ask students frequently to explain to me what I
had just said to make sure that they, in fact, did understand it.
Luu: This is more of a fun question, but what did you enjoy about teaching at
Stanford?

34

Strober: [00:55:13] Oh, I love teaching at Stanford. I absolutely love it. Where can you
find such smart people? Well, I found very smart people at Berkeley, too, let
me say. [laughter] But really, such smart students, highly motivated,
interesting, diverse, a new idea every ten minutes, asking great questions,
finding fabulous paper topics. I couldn’t have enjoyed myself more.
I love teaching, and now that I’m retired, I’m still teaching, believe it
or not, back at the Business School, and the same thing is true. I’m teaching
Work and Family. I have more men in my class than I ever had before.
Imagine, when I first started, all those hostile men. Now at least a third, and
often 40 percent, of my class in Work and Family are men. They write papers
asking how they can be the best father they’re capable of being, what the
effect of childcare is likely to be on their children, and how they can help
achieve flexibility for their employees when they are managers in order to
give people the opportunity to combine work and family. I have had one of
the most satisfying careers I can imagine.
Luu: How did you manage to handle your family life and your career and being
director of the Center on Research for Women?
Strober: [00:57:02] Well, I wasn’t getting a lot of sleep. Seriously, I wasn’t. When my
children finally went off to high school and I could get more sleep, I realized
that I had had a sleep deficit for a long time. But my former husband was at
the Medical School and he had a very demanding job, too, and he wasn’t
really into sharing housework or childcare, so I really did it all.
[00:57:40] And then our marriage pretty much came apart in the early
1980s, and we divorced. My children were fourteen and twelve, and that was

35

a really hard time because I was basically a single parent for a long time. They
saw their father, but he wasn’t living in my house, and he wasn’t involved in
their day-to-day care. But we got very close, my two children and I, and they
were very supportive of me, and I of them, and we got through it.
Then I was a resident fellow for the last two years of my daughter’s
high school because she thought that things were going to be very lonely in
our house when her brother went off to college. So I said, “Well, maybe we
should move into the dorm,” and she thought that was a fabulous idea. I was
a resident fellow in Schiff House for two years, and she and I both lived in
the dorm. The Stanford students treated her like their little sister, and she just
had a wonderful time there.
Then I was single for a long time. I had another relationship, but it
didn’t last, although it lasted for five years. Then I met Jay Jackman, the man
who is my husband now, but I didn’t really “meet” him, because I had met
him before, way back in 1960, soon after I’d met my first husband, because
Jay was my first husband’s classmate and fraternity brother.
In the 1970s, Jay and his former wife, Judith, had moved to Hawaii
and raised their family there. Judith and Jay got divorced just around the
same time that Sam and I got divorced. Then, Jay brought his kids from
Hawaii to the Bay Area when they were looking at colleges. He stayed at my
house, and we became good friends. In the summer of 1989, our friendship
changed, and we decided that he would move back from Hawaii and we’d get
married, which we did in the fall of 1990 in my backyard, with leis and
flowers that his friends all brought from Hawaii.

36

We just have a wonderful, wonderful marriage. We share everything.
We’ve written together. We’ve done consulting together. He’s a psychiatrist,
and when he moved to Palo Alto, he decided not to open up a private
practice, which was what he’d been doing in Hawaii, and he became an
expert witness in criminal cases.
Luu: Going back to your time at the Center for Research on Women, what were
some of the challenges that you faced during the beginning when you were
starting the center?
Strober: [01:01:42] Well, our biggest challenge was money. Mariam Chamberlain at
the Ford Foundation told me that I needed to get a commitment from the
provost at Stanford, Bill [William] Miller, that when the Ford money came,
Stanford would put money in as well, and they did. Bill made it very clear,
though, that Stanford was never going to fully support the center, that we
had to have outside funds. And it was very hard to get outside funds because
the Development Office was really uncooperative.
I remember one time—IBM was very interested in having more
women in management and in science, so when they did a site visit at
Stanford, one person came to the Center for Research on Women and met
with me and was very excited about the center. Then the Development
Office told me we couldn’t ask them for more than $5,000 because the
Development Office wanted IBM to give money to the School of
Engineering, not to the Center for Research on Women. We were very low
on the Development Office’s priority list, and every time I said I wanted to
approach whoever, they said, “Oh, no, no, no, that person is reserved for—.”

37

So I finally decided that I was better off without them than with them, and I
just went off and did my thing without telling them. Then when a check
came, they never asked me to return it.
But it was very hard, because women who had their own money were
generally widows, they had money managers who were men, and even
though the women were interested in supporting research on women, their
money managers were not. And the women were not sophisticated enough
or aggressive enough to say to their money manager, “Look, it’s my money.
We’re going to give the gift here.” And so it was very hard to get money.
It’s interesting. The center’s first major gift came years later from
Barbara Finberg, who had been a trustee at Stanford, and who had her own
money, and she endowed the directorship of the center. By then I think it
was called IRWG, the Institute for Research on Women and Gender. It has
changed its name three times. It started as Center for Research on Women,
then Institute for Research on Women and Gender, and then one of the
students from the Business School, Michelle Clayman, who went to New
York and was very successful in her company and also had her own money,
endowed the whole center, and now it’s called the Michelle Clayman Institute
for Gender Research.
So finally when there were women who had their own money, they
donated it to the center, the institute, and so that’s what’s enabled the
institute—well, that’s not the only thing, but it has enabled the institute to
flourish. We struggled so hard for money when we started out. We never

38

actually did a bake sale [laughs], but we spent so much time asking for so
little money that we might as well have had a bake sale.
Luu: How did the center change over time?
Strober: [01:05:57] Well, there have been many directors since me. When I went back
to the Business School full-time in 1976, Diane Middlebrook came on as
director. She was an English professor. Her interest was literature. Then I
came back after that, and then Deborah Rhode from the Law School was the
director, and she also had an emphasis on women and work. Then Iris Litt
came on from the Medical School, and the main focus of the center became
women’s health.
I’m probably skipping a few directors in here, but Laura Carstensen
came on, and her interest was in longevity, and so she was interested in
women’s longevity. Then Londa Schiebinger was director, and she was
interested in women and science. Now Shelley Correll is back to women and
work. The Center/Institute changes its focus depending on who the director
is.
Luu: Even after you weren’t director, you were still involved?
Strober: [01:07:30] Oh, I’ve always been involved. My children kid me that the center
is my third child. [laughter] And Shelley, Shelley Correll, asked me a couple
years ago to join the center’s advisory board as a life member, and she also
asked the three women students who helped me to found the center to do
that as well. So Beth Garfield, Cynthia Davis and Susan Hecht are also life
members. Susan Hecht passed away this last year, so she’s not on the

39

advisory board anymore. But I am very much involved in the institute. It
really is like a third child. [laughs]
Luu: What are some of the programs that were put on by the center?
Strober: [01:08:43] You mean now?
Luu: Or during your time as director or throughout, since you’ve been director.
Strober: [01:08:52] Well, when I was director, we started the CROW Lecture Series.
That was our first activity, even before we had money from Ford. And that
was really amazing, because at that time there was so little scholarship on
women, one person like me, an economist, could know what was going on in
anthropology, know what was going on in law, and what was going on in
literature.
Diane Middlebrook started something called the CROW Group,
which was faculty from all those various fields. We would meet throughout
the year, and really by the end of the year, each of us knew what there was to
be known about women’s studies in these disciplines—say, Estelle Freedman
in history—because there was so little at the time.
Then scholarship just skyrocketed. Now I don’t even know all of
what’s going on concerning women in economics, let alone in all of those
other fields.
But the original CROW Lecture Series was just a marvelous thing. I
got permission from the Business School to hold lectures for the center in
Business School classrooms, and so many people came. People were sitting on
the floor and people were sitting in the aisles. I thought we were going to be
thrown out by the fire marshal.

40

Most of the people who came were secretaries on campus. The
number of secretaries on campus has been greatly diminished now that we
have computers, but it used to be that every professor had a secretary. Well,
not every professor, no, a secretary would be shared by three or four
professors. But you can imagine how many secretaries there were. They were
all women, and they were all thrilled that there was now this Center for
Research on Women with lectures every week, and they all came. They
brought their lunches. Also, women came from Los Altos Hills, from
Atherton. There were many more women from the community than there
were students. Some students came, but women students were much less
interested in all of this than adult women, both at Stanford and beyond.
Luu: What were the subjects of these lecture series?
Strober: [01:11:37] Well, the first one was on everything conceivable, including bride
wealth in Africa, affirmative action, the law, changes in the law, women and
work. Questions like: Is a novel different if it’s written by a woman than if
it’s written by a man? Can you tell that the novel was different? Do women
write differently from men? Sex differences in children. All these questions
that we had. Why are there so few women in science? Some of these
questions we still have today.
[01:12:33] So it was a time of tremendous intellectual ferment.
Childcare, how can we get a childcare system? That’s still a question.
Luu: Did these lecture series continue after your time as director?

41

Strober: [01:12:54] Yes. For many years the CROW Lecture Series at noon was one of
the main events of the campus, and eventually the center hired Margo Davis,
who was in charge of the lecture series and got outside money for it.
One of the most interesting debates at CROW was whether to take
money from the Playboy Foundation, which wanted to fund one of our
lecture series on Women and the Media. I thought we should take the
money, and the provost, Bill Miller, thought we should take it. Bill Miller said
he thought we should be like the Catholic Church and figure that the money
was cleansed in the giving. But other people argued that we should not take
the money. Nan [Nannerl] Keohane, who ultimately became president of
Wellesley and president of Duke, felt we should not take the money, that we
didn’t want the Playboy Foundation to advertise that they were supporting
us, because that made them look good. So in the end, we didn’t take the
money, and I had to go to Bill Miller and explain why we didn’t take the
money. That was hard. Stanford was not used to faculty turning down
outside money.

STANFORD PIONEERING WOMEN PROJECT

INTERVIEWER:

VY LUU

INTERVIEWEE:

MYRA H. STROBER

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MAY 14, 2014

Luu: This is Vy Luu. It is May 14, 2014. I’m here with Myra Strober to conduct
the second session of our oral history interview for the Pioneering Women
Project for the Stanford Historical Society. We are conducting the interview
in Myra’s home.
Myra, in our last interview session we had talked about your time at
the Graduate School of Business, your time at the School of Education, and
also about the Center for Research on Women. I was wondering if we can
talk about when you came back to the Graduate School of Business, because
I know you started teaching there again.
Strober: [00:00:40] Yes, I began teaching at the Business School again in the early
2000s. I first came back from a two-year leave of absence in 2000 while I was
in Ithaca, New York, and sometime after that, 2001 or 2002, somewhere in
there, the Business School wanted me to be the director of the joint degree
program between the Business School and the Ed School, in which a student
could get both a master’s degree in education and an MBA in two years, by
taking the right combination of courses.

43

I began to direct that program sometime in the early 2000s, and at
the same time, the Business School began to cross-list some of my courses
on the economics of education, and Business School students began taking
those courses. Then Joanne Martin went on sabbatical, and I taught a course
on women and work while she was away. When she came back, she told the
dean that she thought that the Business School could stand to have two
courses on women, hers on women and organizations and mine on women
and work, and he agreed. So I began teaching my course on women and
work at the Business School around 2003, somewhere around there.
Luu: In regard to your experiences with trying to get tenure over at the Graduate
School of Business, do you know how this experience compared with other
women’ experience around that time?
Strober: [00:02:47] Other women who tried to get tenure at business schools?
Luu: At Stanford.
Strober: [00:02:53] Oh, at Stanford. Not all women had trouble, but many did. Diane
Middlebrook had trouble with a promotion from associate professor to full
professor in the English Department. Estelle Freedman had trouble with
tenure in the History Department. Sandra Bem was turned down for tenure
in the Psychology Department. She left Stanford and went to Cornell. It was
a hard time for women at Stanford.
Luu: Another thing that you mentioned in our previous interview, when I asked
you about your salary compared to others, you mentioned that later on you
were in a position to know what the salaries were.
Strober: [00:03:48] Right.

44

Luu: Can you tell me more about that?
Strober: [00:03:50] Well, sometime in the early 2000s, Nel Noddings became the
acting dean of the School of Education, and she appointed me to be the
associate dean, and in that position I had access to everybody’s salary, and so
I could see how very poorly I was paid as compared to my colleagues with
the same experience as I. And Nel was paid poorly, too, so she was very
sympathetic about my being paid poorly, and she recommended a hefty
salary increase for me, which the provost granted.
But also when I chaired the Committee on Recruitment and
Retention of Women Faculty that Jerry [Gerald] Lieberman had appointed, I
told him that we could not possibly talk about the factors that were holding
women back at Stanford without knowing something about salaries. He was
very reluctant to give me any salary data, but finally he agreed to having me
and two other members of the committee come into his office and look at
the salary data, which I had asked him to organize by quintile for full
professors at each school.
Basically, he created scatter plots—years since Ph.D. degree graphed
against salary. I suggested that he put a little red circle around each plot point
that represented a woman, and because there were so few women, you could
easily see the pattern for each school. There were lots of little red circles in
the lowest quintile and almost none in the upper quintile. It was obvious that
women were disadvantaged, particularly in the upper ranges of experience,
and part of that was because men would get offers from other universities
and come back to their department chairs and say, “You know, if you want

45

to keep me you’ll have to increase my salary and match my offer from….”
Fill in the blank. Princeton, Yale, wherever. Women were much less likely to
seek these outside offers and much less likely to get them. Often they were in
two-career families, and they really couldn’t move. Sometimes they were
concerned about their children in school and didn’t want to move their
children. Whatever the reasons, women were not bargaining for increases by
seeking and receiving outside offers, and so even when the salary scale was
fair for new assistant professors, male and female, it got out of whack very
quickly once people had a PhD, say, more than seven or eight years.
Luu: This was when you were chair of the Committee on Recruitment and
Retention of Women Faculty?
Strober: [00:07:45] That’s right.
Luu: It was in 1992 or 1993. Is that correct?
Strober: [00:07:57] Yes, that seems about right.
Luu: Do you remember what led the provost to create this committee?
Strober: [00:08:05] Well, he knew that we were not doing well as compared to our
peer institutions, and so he wanted to know what was going on at Stanford
that was causing us to fall behind in terms of recruiting and retaining women.
He and I developed a good working relationship years before when I was
director of CROW and he was vice provost for research, and so I think he
trusted me, and he knew that I was interested in this subject, so he appointed
me as the chair of the committee.
Luu: What did the committee do in order to compile research on what the state
for women was like at Stanford?

46

Strober: [00:09:02] We were able to get statistical data on other peer universities. We
looked at universities in the Ivy League, and also at universities in the Pac-10
that we played football against, and we added MIT and Caltech to the mix.
That was the group that we compared ourselves to. We were able to get
those data in terms of percentage of women in the various ranks.
But to try to get a handle on what women were thinking and feeling,
we did interviews of Stanford faculty, and each of the committee members
participated in conducting interviews with focus groups. We decided to
concentrate on junior women, and we decided to interview men as well as
women, because we wanted to know which problems were problems for all
junior faculty and which were women’s problems in particular. So we were
able to sort that out pretty well.
One of our major findings was that there was not a culture of
support at Stanford, that departments went to great trouble to bring the best
and the brightest junior faculty to Stanford and then proceeded to ignore
them. There were faculty who told us they couldn’t even get senior people in
their department to read their work, and they didn’t feel supported. This was
men and women. Then a lot of women told us they felt underpaid. And there
were problems with sexual harassment, particularly in the Medical School.
We recommended that Stanford pay attention to this culture of nonsupport
and try to create a new culture of support, and that the university look pretty
carefully at the salary system to figure out what to do about these grave
disparities in salaries between women and men.

47

By the time our committee reported, Jerry was no longer provost,
and, actually, one of the people on our committee, Condoleezza Rice, had
become provost, and so she resigned from the committee because she could
not be on the committee and also be the one to receive the report. Gerhard
Casper, who was the new president, was very interested in all of these topics,
and Condi was interested, too, so they appointed a new vice provost for
faculty affairs to be particularly concerned with women’s salaries. And the
technique that Jerry had used to present data to our committee became
institutionalized, so that every year the provost asked the deans to present
those kinds of scatter plots to show how women were doing in their salaries
as compared to men in their peer group.
Then after a while, the analysis got more sophisticated. Nancy Tuma
and John Pencavel began running regressions. Of course, it’s very difficult to
know what to hold constant in these regressions, because if you hold
constant too many things, then there’s no disparity at all, and if you’re
holding constant some of the factors that are, in fact, discriminatory, then
you’ve giving away the game.
Bob [Robert] Weisberg was appointed shortly after my committee’s
report as someone in the Provost’s Office to whom any woman who felt she
was being underpaid could go and talk to because, as I said to you, it was a
little hard to know whether you were being underpaid. So you would go to
Bob, and he would look at the data, and then he would say, “Yes, you’re
underpaid,” or “No, you’re not underpaid.” And if you were underpaid, you

48

could get a salary increase, and many women on the faculty did get salary
increases in that way.
But that’s kind of trying to fix the barn after the horse is already out.
Giving people salary increases because they’d been discriminated against for
years is not really a good solution to this problem. It’s an important solution
for the particular women involved, but it was necessary to get a more
systemic picture of how salaries were being set and why these disparities were
arising. And I think Bob did a good job of trying to figure out what was
going on and what the pockets of disparity were and trying to give women
increases. Women got very large salary increases. But they didn’t get them
retrospectively, so if you’d been underpaid for twenty years that was not
going to be remedied. I’ve never tried to calculate how much money I lost
over the years because I was underpaid, and by how much my retirement
account is lower, but I can tell you that it is a substantial amount. I think it
would be too depressing to actually know how substantial.
Luu: It sounds like in the report that the committee made, you suggested changes
that the university should make. Looking back now, do you think the
university actually tried to make those changes?
Strober: [00:15:40] I think that the biggest change that was made was by Gerhard
Casper, who was, after all, a law professor and very concerned about sexual
harassment and the university’s obligations and liabilities. So he created a
sexual harassment reporting system that I think was very good and continues
to be very good. Particularly he created a group of people--and I was one of
them--who were called sexual harassment advisors. I always used to joke that

49

if anybody wanted to sexually harass somebody, they had to come to me first
for my advice. [laughter] But we were called advisors, and the good thing was
that our names were publicized, and anybody from any place in the university
could come and talk to any of the advisors. So if you were a woman in
Chemistry and you didn’t want to talk to an advisor in the sciences because
you wanted more anonymity than that, you could come and talk to me, and
many women from the sciences did come and talk to me.
Gerhard was very concerned about due process for the person who
was being accused, and he was also concerned about the rights of the person
who was doing the accusing, and I think he set up a system that was fair. It’s
not perfect. Many women suffer sexual harassment and don’t report it
because they fear for their future, particularly graduate students, where it
might get around in their discipline that they have complained in this way,
and they’re fearful that they won’t get an assistant professor position. So it
isn’t perfect.
But the other thing Casper did was to hire Laraine Zappert to run
this program, and she is a therapist and very sensitive to all these issues of
rights and responsibilities. She trained all the advisors, and she often worked
behind the scenes, so if someone, for instance, would come to me with a
complaint, I would go to her.
Let me backtrack a minute. As an advisor, I had to be very careful to
tell the person who was coming to talk to me that if she told me the name of
the person who was being accused, that it was my responsibility to report
that to Laraine. But the woman didn’t have to tell me the name of the

50

person. She could come to me and tell her story and get advice without
telling me the name, in which case I would tell Laraine that a complaint had
been made. But I wouldn’t tell her by whom, and I wouldn’t tell her,
obviously, who was being accused because I didn’t know myself.
But if the woman complaining told me who she was accusing, even if
she didn’t want to file a complaint, Laraine might talk to her and kind of
work behind the scenes. So, for example, one time there was a complaint,
and Laraine suggested that I go to the faculty member who was being
accused, with that faculty member’s department chair, and just sort of tell
that person that there had been somebody who had talked to me and maybe
this faculty member wanted to be a little more circumspect in the future. And
you would be surprised, this works well. Faculty members, when they are
confronted by their peers who tell them, “This is not acceptable behavior at
this university,” may well reform.
Luu: That’s good to hear.
Strober: [00:20:28] Yes. So I think, as I say, the system is not perfect, but I think that
in many instances the system works well.
Luu: Did you find that after the report of the committee was made, Stanford
compared better to its peer institutions in regards to retention and
recruitment of women?
Strober: [00:20:53] I’m not sure I’ve seen comparisons. But Stanford most certainly
got better. We increased our percentage of women, and the salary disparities
got smaller. I’m not sure about the culture of support. I think it improved
somewhat.

51

One of the costs to me of having chaired that committee was that
then I was known all over campus as someone who was concerned about
these problems, so I had many visits from very unhappy women, particularly
at the Medical School and in the sciences, who had been turned down for
tenure or for promotion and felt the decisions were unfair and were
considering suing. They would all come to my office with manila folders
filled with papers, and they would show them to me, and I would try my best
to be sympathetic. I would tell them, of course, that I had no power to do
anything on their behalf, but they would leave their folders with me. So
eventually I had a whole file drawer filled with folders of people’s very
unhappy stories.
When I went off to Ithaca for my two-year leave of absence, I went
through them all, and it was very painful for me, because these were stories
of people who had had a very hard time, just like I had had a hard time, and
there was nothing I could do for them. There was no point in my hanging
onto their folders anymore, so with great pain, I threw them away, and I was
glad to leave Stanford for two years, because by the time I came back,
women had found other women to go and talk to, and so I was off the hook.
Luu: Could you tell me more about your experiences as one of the sexual
harassment advisors?
Strober: [00:23:40] Well, I thought the trainings were excellent when I started out.
After all, I don’t have a background in counseling of any sort. And I thought
the sessions that Laraine organized were very helpful in terms of
understanding what Stanford’s policy was, understanding what the law was,

52

and understanding how to listen to people who are in great pain. The same
thing with the women who came to me with their terribly sad stories about
tenure and promotion. At least I could provide a sympathetic ear and a warm
heart, and that was helpful to them, and I think that was true for the
harassment situations too.
Sometimes the women didn’t understand what exactly was happening
to them because there was very little quid pro quo sexual harassment, where
a faculty member would say, “If you don’t sleep with me, I’m going to give
you a failing grade.” It was more what we called hostile environment
harassment, and particularly in the sciences where there were very few
women and the environment was very male and very hostile, situations arose
like going to strip clubs at meetings off campus.
So one of the things I did was to provide a sounding board for these
women to say, “Yes, what I’m experiencing is in fact harassment, and, no, I
don’t have to put up with this.” What I would tell them is that whether they
wanted to file a formal complaint or not, perhaps they just wanted to absent
themselves from difficult situations. I assured them that it was not part of
their job description, formal or informal, to go to strip clubs. And also I
spent time teaching women to say no, because the first part of the training
really was that if somebody is being sexually harassed, they need to make it
very clear to the harasser that they want this to stop, and some of the women
had not done that, and so I counseled them to do that and then see what
happened. Sometimes a couple of words did the trick, and sometimes it
didn’t.

53

Luu: Can you tell me about your time working on the Signs journal?
Strober: That was a very exciting time. We competed with Wellesley College--we were
the two finalists--to bring the journal to Stanford. The journal had been
started by Catharine Stimpson in ‘75 at Barnard College. The University of
Chicago owned the journal, and Catharine and the University of Chicago
Press felt that it would be good for the journal to rotate venue every five
years, get fresh blood into the editorial team, and so the University of
Chicago Press held a competition for the next venue.
When I heard about this, I went and talked to Barbara Gelpi and
asked her if she would be interested in being editor, and she was excited and
said yes. Then we put together a marvelous editorial team: Carol Jacklin from
Psychology, Shelly [Michelle] Rosaldo from Anthropology, Estelle Freedman
from History, Nan Keohane from Political Science, and myself. I can’t
remember whether Jane Collier was on the team to begin with or she came
later.
But anyway, we were successful in our competition. We had
wonderful support from both the provost and the president. Don [Donald]
Kennedy, who was provost when I first went and told him about it, said he
knew that support from Stanford was going to be critical here, and said,
“Now, you just let me know what you need me to do to get this journal
here.”
When the University of Chicago Press came to campus for their site
visit, Don was very charming and explained to them how much Stanford

54

wanted the journal, and then they met with Dick [Richard] Lyman, who was
president, who was also very supportive.
Luu: So it stayed at Stanford for the next five years?
Strober: [00:29:54] It stayed at Stanford for the next five years, yes.
Luu: What was your role with Signs?
Strober: [00:30:02] Well, at that time feminism was bursting its intellectual seams.
There was so much new material coming out, and because Signs was the
preeminent journal in women’s studies, all these manuscripts came to us, and
so our graduate students were able to read things even before they were
published, and we were able to discuss all these new ideas. It was a crossdisciplinary team because we had submissions from all these disciplines, and
it was very exciting trying to figure out how much of the journal’s space
should be on psychology, how much should be on literature, how much
should be on economics. Those decisions had to be made.
Then we had a wonderful conference on women and communities
and published an issue on that subject, including women in Catholicism. We
had Joan Chittister, who was the abbess of a Benedictine abbey in Erie,
Pennsylvania, come to the conference, and she gave a sensational final
address.
The faculty members who were doing this and the graduate students
who were doing this bonded strongly, and then we became preeminent in
terms of Stanford’s association with women’s studies because the journal was
here.

55

Luu: Are there any other special appointments or positions or leadership roles that
you had at Stanford that you would like to discuss?
Strober: [00:32:09] The School of Education doesn’t have chairs of departments
because it doesn’t have departments, but it has areas, and I was chair of the
area of administration and policy analysis, so I played a leadership role there.
The program that I told you about earlier on, the joint degree between the
Business School and the Ed School, came out of that area committee. Mike
[Michael] Kirst, who was in that area committee, was the chair of that joint
degree program before I was. That gave me some practice in a leadership
role, being chair of the area committee.
Then I was associate dean, and then I was acting dean of the School
of Education because the dean that they appointed after Nel Noddings was
Rich [Richard] Shavelson and he couldn’t come right away, so I was acting
dean during the time after he was appointed but before he came.
Luu: We can move on to talking about the research and publications that you
made during your time at Stanford. This is a really broad question, but what
was some of the research that you did? What did it focus on?
Strober: [00:33:50] Well, the two areas that I was most concerned with were
occupational segregation and the economics of childcare. I did a tremendous
amount of work on occupational segregation. Why was it that women and
men had different kinds of occupations, and why was it that men’s
occupations were paid more than women’s?
I looked at how teaching became a women’s occupation in the
nineteenth century. I did that with David Tyack. The extant theory at that

56

time was that women became teachers because they were cheaper to hire
than men. But that just didn’t make any sense to me, because women were
cheaper to hire for all occupations. So how come women were teachers but
they were not physicians, they were not lawyers, and they were not CEOs?
So I said, “This cheapness hypothesis really does not explain what was going
on. Why did women become teachers?”
David and I looked at this very carefully, and I developed the relative
attractiveness theory, which says that men get first choice of occupations
because they are presumed to be the breadwinners in their families, and so
why wouldn’t you give them first choice? And they choose the occupations
that are relatively attractive, given their level of education. So if you have only
a high school education or less, an attractive occupation might be truck
driver, because the pay is good and the pay increases over time and the
benefits are good. If you have a college degree, then a relatively attractive
occupation might be physician or lawyer or dentist. Of course, you would
have to get a post-graduate degree, but that would be a good direction to go.
So once men fill up the attractive occupations, then the ones that are
less attractive are available for women who meet the educational criteria. In
teaching, there were two separate labor markets: one was in cities and one
was in the countryside. In cities women were teachers from the beginning
because the system was set up like a factory. The wages were low, the
education requirements were high, and it was not an attractive occupation for
men, except in high schools where the pay was higher and the intellectual
excitement was greater. So high school teachers were more likely to be men,

57

although still there were a lot of women high school teachers. But elementary
school teachers were pretty much women in the cities. They all had a
principal above them, and the principal was like the father, and if the boys
misbehaved, the women teachers, the equivalent of mothers, sent the boys to
the principal. But otherwise the women taught in the classrooms.
By giving men first choice of occupations, educated women were
prevented from going into occupations like law and medicine, dentistry, and
business. And so very bright, highly educated women went into teaching, and
they also went into nursing, and they went into librarianship. All of these
occupations paid less than the male occupations, and men were not
interested in them, so they were available for women.
In the countryside, men had been teachers of the boys during the
winter, and women were teachers of the girls during the summer and the
winter, but in the summer, the boys and the male teachers all left school to
farm. So they were mainly farmers, these men, but they did some teaching in
the winter when they weren’t farming.
Then the states began putting in all sorts of requirements. As
education requirements increased, they wanted to lengthen the school term,
they wanted people to go to school more years, they wanted teachers to be
recertified, and the men who were teaching, who were basically farmers, said,
“This is not an attractive occupation anymore. I’m a farmer. I’m not going to
a summer institute to learn how to teach better.” So they dropped out of
teaching.

58

So as soon as men moved out, women moved in, and we found this,
too, in bank telling. In 1935 when Princeton University did a study of
employment in banking, they didn’t find a single woman bank teller. When
the researchers asked about this, the bank managers would say, “Women
bank tellers? Who in their right mind would come into a bank and give their
money to a woman?” So there were no women in bank telling.
But then World War II came along, and the men went into the armed
forces, and banks hired women as tellers, and nobody had any problem
giving the women their money. After the war, the banks tried to recruit men
back, because, again, men get first choice of occupations, but now we had a
G.I. Bill. The country had said we want to reward all these men who served
in the armed forces. We want to give them free college tuition. So men who
used to work in banks or might have worked in banks, went off to college.
They didn’t want to be bank tellers. And it used to be, prior to World War II,
that you’d come into the bank as a bank teller, and even with only a high
school education you would work yourself up. I interviewed men who were
vice presidents of the bank when they retired, and they had no more than a
high school education.
But then all of that stopped. Men went to college, women went into
bank telling, and, guess what? All of these ladders up disappeared. When
women came into bank telling, they stayed in bank telling. They didn’t move
up. And the men who went to college came to the banks at much higher
levels.

59

So, you see, bank telling had been an attractive occupation when men
were in it, because you could move up. But then when women came in, it
became an unattractive occupation, and by 1950, the vast majority of bank
tellers were women. So that’s how the relative attractiveness theory works.
Luu: Could you tell me more about your research on childcare?
Strober: [00:41:59] I was very interested in the fact that there was so little childcare
and childcare workers were so poorly paid. I wanted to understand how we
could revise the system and provide childcare in a group setting, because I
never thought that the solution to women working was to hire poorer
women to take care of their children at home. That just seemed to me
ridiculous. I thought we should have childcare run by loving people who
were experts in childcare, who were reasonably paid, sort of like teachers, but
teachers of very young children. I wanted to understand why this hadn’t
happened and, beyond that, what we could do to make it happen.
In 1971, it almost happened, because Congress passed a bill that
would have created a national system of childcare, but President Nixon
vetoed it. He said he thought it would weaken the family. And there’s been
no comprehensive childcare bill since.
I did a study on childcare centers as workplaces and interviewed
childcare workers about their concerns. I learned that it’s just an extremely
difficult job. Not only is the pay very poor, but many of the childcare aides
have very little training. There are no substitutes, so if a teacher gets sick,
which happens all the time because they’re around young children, then all
hell breaks loose because the government has mandated certain adult-child

60

ratios, and if a teacher gets sick, there’s no substitute. The cook has to come
out of the kitchen and become a teacher so that there are enough adults in
the classrooms. So everybody’s stressed, and it’s just a difficult system.
Luu: What were some of the reactions to your research during your time at
Stanford?
Strober: [00:44:47] Well, when I first came to the Business School, I had already been
doing research on childcare, and they asked me to give a seminar within the
first couple of weeks that I was there. I decided I would talk about childcare,
because that’s what I had been researching. I knew it was a controversial
topic, but I was trying to talk about the economics of childcare and what the
economic rationale for childcare subsidization would be, and I said that
childcare was equivalent to education and that the same reason why the
government provides universal education is the reason why government
should provide universal childcare.
Well, my colleagues never let me finish more than five minutes of my
talk. They were incensed. “More government intervention? We need less
government, not more government. Why are you telling us this?” The man
who was ostensibly running this seminar, Lee [George Leland] Bach, never
said a word to my colleagues, never told them to be quiet and let me
continue, and I was too new at the game to tell them myself. So they just
ranted among themselves, and finally the forty-five minutes was up, and I
left.
Everybody knew this was a disaster, and at least three of my
colleagues came to me within a couple of days to advise me to stop doing

61

work on childcare, that this was not a suitable topic, that I should do some
other work until I got tenure, and then once I got tenure, I could work on
whatever I wanted. But in the meantime, they didn’t want me to work on
childcare. I listened to them, and I thought, “I’m not going to take their
advice, because I’m all fired up about childcare, and if I’m going to be in
academia, I’m going to do research on what I want to do research on. And if
not, I might as well go work for a big bank and get a lot higher salary than
I’m getting here.”
So I just kept doing my thing, working on childcare, and working on
occupational segregation. I also worked on the difference in spending habits
between two-earner and single-earner families. I wanted to find out if you
have two families, and each earns the same total amount of income, but in
one family, the husband earns it all, and in the other family, the wife and the
husband both earn it, is there a difference in their spending? And the answer
is “Yes,” because the family with two earners spends more on childcare and
more on transportation and clothing.
If the total incomes are the same for the two kinds of families, the
family with one earner saves a lot more money than the family with two
earners. So over time, that family became better and better off, because they
have more wealth because they save more. So even though they have the
same incomes, these two kinds of families are very different.
Luu: How did the reactions to your research change over time, or when did they
begin to change?

62

Strober: [00:49:13] Well, the Business School never clearly defined my field. I called it
women and work, but we never had a discussion of what my field was, and,
again, I was too new to the game to know that this was what you were
supposed to do. But they knew that this was what you were supposed to do,
and why they didn’t do it, I can’t tell you, but they didn’t.
So when it came time for me to come up for tenure, I had colleagues
coming to me to tell me they were very worried about this tenure decision.
And I said to them, “You’re worried? I’m worried.” Well, they said, my field is
too new, my field is too female, I don’t have enough men writing for me; you
know, their complaints were legion. But all of this should have been figured
out long before I came up for tenure, and it wasn’t.
So what were their reactions to my work? You know, I don’t really
know. [laughter] One of them told me I didn’t hit a home run, which, I
thought to myself, was a real male metaphor. And he told me that my work
was not seminal. I thought, “Oh, boy, a second male metaphor.”
Luu: Can you tell me about the books you have published?
Strober: [00:51:19] I did an edited book with Sandy Dornbusch from Sociology called
Feminism and the New Families, and I did a book with some people from Signs
on women and poverty.
But the first book where I was an author was with Agnes Chan. We
looked at the graduates of Stanford and the graduates of Tokyo University. It
was the 1980 graduates, and we surveyed them in 1990. We wanted to know
how women and men had fared in comparison to one another over those ten
years. There were women from Stanford who, despite their education, did

63

not work, were not employed. The same thing for the graduates from Tokyo
University. The male-female salary differential between graduates at Stanford
was about the same as the differential from the graduates at Tokyo. That was
surprising. Most people thought that earnings differentials would be higher in
Japan than in the United States, but it wasn’t the case.
Very few of the Stanford men were helping with housework, but an
even smaller percentage of the Japanese men were helping with housework.
So it was an interesting comparison of the two cultures and the two sets of
very highly educated women and men and what happened to them over the
ten-year period.
Luu: How did you and Agnes begin to work on this research together?
Strober: [00:53:10] Well, Agnes was my student, and when she first came to Stanford,
she was one of the research assistants on the project to analyze the Stanford
data. She got interested in that topic and did her own dissertation on the
graduates of Tokyo. Then, after she finished her dissertation, we decided to
put together the two sets of data, and we wrote that book.
Luu: That’s interesting. I don’t really have any other points I want to address on
my outline, but is there anything that you would like to discuss about your
time at Stanford that you don’t think we have covered?
Strober: [00:53:58] Well, the last chapter of my memoir is called “If You Live Long
Enough.” I have returned to the Business School and I’m a very popular
teacher now over there. I taught a course just a month or so ago on work and
family, and I had put a limit of sixty students on it. It was filled and there was

64

a waiting list of another fifty-three students, so I could have taught another
section, which I didn’t want to do.
I get letters from the current dean, Garth Saloner, telling me that he
thanks me for all I do for the Business School, so it’s a very different world
than when I was there before.
Luu: That’s very good to hear. [laughs]
Strober: [00:54:55] I think over time, things have changed, not only for me, but for all
women. I think Stanford is a far better place to work. I think that women are
welcome at Stanford and faculty women are welcome. I was a pioneer.
At the time I didn’t quite realize that I was a pioneer, but as I look
back, I certainly was. By and large, I enjoyed it. It was a good run, and if I
had it to do over again, I hope I’d be smarter, but I certainly am glad that I
persisted at Stanford, that I succeeded at Stanford, that I got to spend my
career at this fabulous place. I turned out to be lucky.
Luu: I guess I just have one last follow-up question. Do you think there are still
improvements or changes that could be made now at Stanford in regards to
how women faculty members are treated?
Strober: [00:56:19] I think that the situation in the STEM fields [science, technology,
engineering, mathematics], and even in economics to some degree, is not as
good as it could be, and I think the university recognizes this and is trying to
remedy this. This is a social and economic problem of long standing, and it’s
going to take a while to change, but I think that in engineering and computer
science and physics, there are still bastions of maleness that will eventually
need to change and, I think, will change.

65

Luu: Thank you so much for your time, Myra.

Luu: Thank you for participating in the interview.
