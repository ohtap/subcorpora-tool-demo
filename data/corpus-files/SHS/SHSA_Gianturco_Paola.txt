Introduction
This oral history was conducted by the Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program in
collaboration with the Stanford University Archives. The program is under the direction of
the Oral History Committee of the Stanford Historical Society.
The Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program furthers the Society’s mission “to
foster and support the documentation, study, publication, dissemination, and preservation of
the history of the Leland Stanford Junior University.” The program explores the institutional
history of the University, with an emphasis on the transformative post-WWII period,
through interviews with leading faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and others. The interview
recordings and transcripts provide valuable additions to the existing collection of written and
photographic materials in the Stanford University Archives.
Oral history is not a final, verified, or complete narrative of events. It is a unique, reflective,
spoken account, offered by the interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it may be
deeply personal. Each oral history is a reflection of the past as the interviewee remembers
and recounts it. But memory and meaning vary from person to person; others may recall
events differently. Used as primary source material, any one oral history will be compared
with and evaluated in light of other evidence, such as contemporary texts and other oral
histories, in arriving at an interpretation of the past. Although the interviewees have a past or
current connection with Stanford University, they are not speaking as representatives of the
University.
Each transcript is edited by program staff and by the interviewee for grammar, syntax, and
occasional inaccuracies and to aid in overall clarity and readability--but is not fact-checked as
such. The approach is to maintain the substantive content of the interview as well as the
interviewee’s voice. As a result of this editing process, the transcript may not match the
recording verbatim. If a substantive deletion has been made, this is generally indicated at the
relevant place on the transcript. Substantive additions are noted in brackets or by footnote.

the interviewee and the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University
(“Stanford”). The copyright to the transcripts and recordings, including the right to publish,
is reserved by Stanford University.

Paola Gianturco
Biography
Paola Gianturco, an award-winning author and photographer with a longstanding
commitment to women’s issues, has documented women’s lives in sixty-two countries with
six published books. She has lectured about women’s issues in the US, Canada, France, the
United Arab Emirates, and Spain. Speaking engagements include an address at UNESCO
International Headquarters in Paris on International Women’s Day in 2008 (where her
photographs were exhibited in 2009 and 2011) and a TED TALK in Dubai in 2014.
Gianturco had a successful career in the advertising industry, including as a principal at Hall
& Levine, the first women-owned advertising agency in the United States. Gianturco has
also co-developed and taught executive institutes on women and leadership at Stanford
University, served on the board of the Association for Women’s Rights in Development
(AWID), and is a current member of the International Women’s Forum. In 2013, Gianturco
was named one of “Forty Women to Watch over Forty,” and in 2014, she was named one of
“Twenty-one Leaders for the Twenty-first Century” by Women’s eNews. In 2017 the
YWCA inducted her into the Marin Women’s Hall of Fame.
Gianturco’s published works imaginatively combine images and text. Her sixth book, Wonder
Girls: Changing Our World was created with her eleven-year-old granddaughter co-author, Alex
Sangster, and released in October 2017. It is the first book to document the work of groups
of activist girls around the world. The fifteen groups featured include girls from age ten to
eighteen who are tackling diverse issues in thirteen countries. The book has won literary
awards in categories as diverse as Women’s Studies, Multicultural Nonfiction, and, most
recently, a Gold in the Social Justice category of the Nautilus Book Awards.
Her fifth book, Grandmother Power: A Global Phenomenon, documents a new, unheralded
international women’s movement. Grandmother Power features 120 activist grandmothers in
grandmother groups across five continents who are fighting courageously and effectively-against poverty, disease, illiteracy, and human rights abuse--to create a better world for
grandchildren everywhere. Grandmother Power has won the 2013 Living Now Book Award’s
Gold Medal--Social Action category, Foreword Reviews’ 2012 Book of the Year Gold
13

Award--Women’s Studies category, the 2013 About.com Readers’ Choice Award for
Favorite Grandparenting Book, and the 2013 International Book Award for Multicultural
Nonfiction.
Women Who Light the Dark was released in 2007. It features women in fifteen countries who
are helping each other with the intractable problems that make life dark for families
everywhere.
Gianturco’s third book, ¡Viva Colores! A Salute to the Indomitable People of Guatemala was
published in September 2006. Its bi-lingual, English/Spanish text was written by David Hill.
Her second book, Celebrating Women (2004) features festivals in fifteen countries that
celebrate women’s accomplishments, attributes, roles, rites of passage, and spiritual lives.
The first exhibit ever curated by the International Museum of Women (San Francisco) was
Celebrating Women. A travelling exhibit was mounted by the Field Museum in Chicago, where
195,000 visitors saw it during seven months in 2008. UNESCO exhibited Celebrating Women
in March 2009 at its world headquarters in Paris. In 2010 and 2011, the show travelled to six
US venues.
Gianturco conceived and, collaborating with Toby Tuttle, was co-author/photographer of In
Her Hands: Craftswomen Changing the World, (hardcover, 2000; paperback, 2004). This book
features women artisans in twelve countries, all sending their children to school with the
money they earn from selling their handicrafts. Photographs from this book have been
exhibited at the United Nations in New York; the United States Senate; the Smithsonian
Museum Folklife Festival in Washington DC, and Chicago’s Field Museum.

Gianturco has been a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, NPR, and CNN. Her photographs
have been published by Harpers Bazaar (Australia), Marie Claire (US, Taiwanese, and Greek
editions), the Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle/Examiner, the Denver Post, the Chicago
Tribune, and on many Internet sites, podcasts, and blogs.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY

PROJECT:

STANFORD ALUMNI INTERVIEWS - PIONEERING WOMEN

INTERVIEWEE:

PAOLA GIANTURCO

INTERVIEWER:

MELISSA DU

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MAY 12, 2018

PART:

1 OF 3

Du: My name is Melissa, and I am here this morning on May 12th with Paola at
nine a.m. in Mill Valley for the Stanford Pioneering Women Oral History
Project.
So, Paola, why don’t you tell me a bit about your upbringing and
where you’re from?
Gianturco: I was born in Urbana, Illinois, where the University of Illinois is. Shall I tell
you a little bit about my family?
Du: Yes, I would love that.
Gianturco: My mother was born in Danville about fifteen miles from [Urbana]. She had
graduated in English from the University of Illinois and expected to be an
English teacher. [There were no] jobs for English teachers, so she accepted
a job as the bookkeeper at a startup hospital and clinic that was being
launched by my father and five other doctors who had been fellows at the
Mayo Clinic.
[00:01:07] She took one look at my father, broke her engagement [to
someone else], and not too long later they were married and stayed married
15

for more than sixty years until both of them died at ninety.
My father came to the United States from Italy. It’s an amazing
family history. His father had been born in the arch of the boot in a tiny
village called Avigliano, and he was taken by his older brother and taught to
read by candlelight in Naples.
Ultimately, my grandfather graduated both from the conservatory of
music--he wrote symphonies for fun--and from law school, and was elected
to Parliament.
[00:02:05] During the course of his life, my grandfather was minister
of education soon after Italy was unified. He unified the education system in
Italy. He was also the minister of transportation and unified the
transportation system. You can see my last name on train stations all over
Italy.
He was then the equivalent of the head of the US Supreme Court.
[As a lawyer, he defended passengers] on a ship that had run aground on
Gibraltar, and he used that money to educate all of his nine children. He
explained to them that that was their legacy--that education was crucially
important. That was his gift to them; [he gave the rest of his money away].
[00:03:00] So my father was, of course, very education-oriented, as
am I, by the way. My father was also something of a genius. When he came
to the United States at age twenty-five as a fellow to the Mayo Clinic, he had
already finished his medical specialties in surgery, radiology, and pathology.
He was always very creative in addition to being very scientific, so he
was always inventing. As I grew up, we knew that we would never find the
16

baking sheets, for example, because they would be in the basement and my
father would be inventing something with the metal. It was hopeless to try
to have a regular life.
[00:03:58] He ultimately retired when he was sixty-five, and spent the
time between when he was sixty-five to ninety-one inventing medical
devices. He was one of the three or four physicians who were responsible
for the development of the subspecialties of interventional radiology and
interventional cardiology, which was wonderful because he was committed
to the idea that in order to be healthier, people shouldn’t have to experience
the trauma of drastic surgery.
He really changed the course of medicine. He gave all of his patents
to the company that produced his devices for a dollar, and he really did save
many, many people’s lives.
[00:05:00] Again, there are lessons everywhere. Not only did I--from
my Italian family--inherit the idea that education was important, but also,
because my father was oriented toward helping people, [I] inherited an
impulse to pay real attention to what people tell me and to use my skills to
make their lives better.
Du: That’s incredible. I’d love to touch a little bit more on your father’s love for
education and how that impacted you, because in the late 1950s, when you
were thinking about applying to college and going to college, around only 6
percent of women had college degrees.
Do you think that your father’s great influence on you really made
you think, “This [a college education] was definitely what I was doing,” or
17

how do you think that this [very few women attending college] affected
what you wanted to do in light of what other women around the United
States or around you were doing?
Gianturco: [00:06:06] Remember I grew up in a university community, so most of the
kids I went to school with from kindergarten on were daughters and sons of
university faculty. There was never any question about my going to school
somewhere.
I was also the valedictorian of my high school class. Already the idea
of learning was fun for me and something that was part of my life from the
beginning. I may have grown up in a bubble from that perspective, but there
was never any question about going on to school.
[00:06:52] Although I will say that, because my father was so focused
on the value of education, when I submitted my Stanford application I
wrote about the idea that I wanted to learn to be empathetic. The night that
[the application] was due--it had to be postmarked by midnight--I asked my
father if he would like to hear what I had written.
He was unglued. It was the only fight I ever had with my father. He
said, “Empathy? You can learn empathy at home. Why would I spend this
much money to send you to this wonderful school to learn to be
empathetic?”
I was so committed to that idea. It really had to do with my sense of
what the world was. It was not, at that point, anywhere nearly as unified as it
now is, thanks to technology and communications.
[00:07:55] But I could see that I was part of the [larger] world. I had
18

grown up with a family that had come from another place. It seemed to me
that [empathy] was crucial to learn. My father just thought it was a big waste
of time.
So I put on my boots in the middle of this winter night and put on
my mittens and my big, heavy coat, and I said, “I am walking to the post
office.” [laughs]
My mother said, “No, no.” [laughs] So my father drove me in total
silence. At midnight--silent post office, dark downtown--I dropped my
application into the mailbox. I was just determined to do it. I am stubborn.
[laughs]
Du: That’s amazing. I’m also very curious. As you were applying to college and
getting ready for the idea of college, what were your parents’ expectations
for you as you were preparing to leave home and getting ready to go to
Stanford?
Gianturco: [00:09:02] Their expectations were that I would do well. [laughs] I had--they
had--we shared a sense that it is an obligation to do what you can do well.
It’s really not a choice.
Everybody has a recurring terrible dream. My terrible dream was that
Baryshnikov [Mikhail Baryshnikov] would come to me and say, “I’m
stopping dancing.” It was just horrifying to me. I would always wake up
almost in tears because it seemed like such a waste. I would say, “No, no,
you can’t.”
Of course Baryshnikov represented me, and I was representing to

19

myself the idea that one needs to take advantage of the skills and talents that
you have. Defection was not an option. [laughs]
Du: [00:10:09] Wow. Once you arrived at Stanford, you majored in history while
you were there. Can you tell me about how you came to this department
and also what it was like at that time?
Gianturco: History Corner was still History Corner way back then. History simply was
an area that interested me, and ultimately it turned out to make a huge
contribution to my life, because I learned to see patterns in what was
happening. That analytic ability--the ability to see patterns and trends--really
shaped how I viewed everything.
[00:11:02] I was interested particularly in Western European history,
which was my specialty--mostly because I grew up during World War II and
I really wanted to understand what [had happened]. My father, who was
much too old to have been drafted, volunteered to be a doctor in the US
Medical Corps because he was so horrified about what Hitler was doing to
the Jews.
I was born in July of 1939 before Europe entered the war in
September. My father was torn because his volunteering later to go to war
put him on the opposite side from his Italian family, and also because he
had to leave his own newly growing family at a very important time.
[00:12:09] My mother tells the story about his walking around and
around and around the outside of the house, thinking and thinking and
thinking. But ultimately he made what I consider to be a very important
moral choice and did become a doctor in the US Army Medical Corps.
20

Du: Wow. So your father’s experiences drew you to the History Department.
What was studying history like? You mentioned Western European history.
Did you have any other interests within the History Department?
Gianturco: There were other courses that were sort of superstar courses at that point,
taught by people who were wonderful theorists and had particular areas of
expertise that were very interesting.
[00:12:57] I remember a course in medieval history that intrigued me
because the professor thought that period could be traced by looking at the
invention of the stirrup, and indeed he was right. There were many courses
that interested me. I found it a provocative area of exploration.
Du: What do you think are some changes that you experienced during your time
at Stanford?
Gianturco: I had always felt growing up that I was kind of an outcast in the middle of
Illinois in the middle of the twentieth century. I was half Italian. There were
no other Italians for hundreds of miles in any direction. I was smart, and--I
don’t know how that is today, but that doesn’t necessarily make you the
most popular person around.
[00:14:09] I was pretty, and that was almost worse than being smart.
[laughs] I was elected to be prom queen, for example. I was also, later on, a
Stanford Quad queen. Do they still have Quad queens? Good. Mortifying. I
mean, talk about discrimination. I always felt that people just viewed me as
an airhead. [laughs]
Du: Can you explain “Quad queen?”

21

Gianturco: There were two students, girls from each class, each year, photographed for
full-page pictures in the Quad, the Stanford yearbook. Later in my life, when
I was responsible for new business for Saatchi & Saatchi, I went to talk to
the vice president of communications at Transamerica.
[00:15:07] I knew he had gone to Stanford. He was a year older than I
am. He said, “I’m so glad to meet you. I remember that you were a Quad
queen.” [laughs] I thought, “Oh my God, I will never live this down.”
When I was elected to be prom queen in high school, nobody invited
me to go [to the dance]. There was no way to get crowned [without
attending]. My mother called Bob Hindsley’s mother and somehow
convinced her to get Bob to take me to this prom. I can imagine this
conversation. “She’s really very nice. It’s only one evening out of his life.”
Oh my goodness.
I had grown up feeling like an outcast, and when I went to Stanford,
I was suddenly surrounded by people who were as smart as I was and
smarter. It was a huge relief. It was wonderful, really, to be able to talk to
people who were always thinking and who were really listening.
[00:16:10] I have good friends from that time, and I married a couple
of Stanford men over the course of the following years, one of whom I have
now been married to for thirty years, and the other one of whom I was
married to for three years, but he is the father of my son.
That actually hints at another thing that was important that happened
at Stanford, and that was: I suddenly had a normal social life. I wasn’t
considered a weirdo. [laughs]
22

[00:16:46] I had also grown up very allergic. Between August and
November of every year, until it frosted in Illinois, I couldn’t breathe.
Suddenly, I was outside of the hay fever zone, which was miraculous. I
could breathe. For the first time, I felt normal on all of these dimensions
that had really been inhibitors.
Du: At Stanford, what were some of your career aspirations, and what did you
think you would do after you had graduated?
Gianturco: For as long as I could remember, I had thought I wanted to be in
advertising. The two men who invented marketing research were Bill
Marsteller [William Marsteller], who was my mother’s first cousin, and
Charles Sandage, who lived down the block from us and taught at the
University of Illinois. The two of them had launched the discipline of
marketing research by interviewing farmers in Illinois.
[00:18:04] When I asked the people in the neighborhood--the fathers
in the neighborhood--most mothers were not working at that point--what
they did that was interesting, Charlie Sandage told me about marketing
research. I thought, “Phew, that sounds really interesting.”
He was so excited about it because they were really forging new
avenues of exploration and I thought, “That’s what I want to do.” And, of
course, advertising is what I did for some thirty-four years.
Du: When you were thinking that you really wanted to go into market research,
were there any role models that you had very early on, perhaps other
women in these industries that you looked up to, or did you just generally
have this excitement and passion for market research?
23

Gianturco: [00:18:53] The latter. I didn’t know anyone except Bill Marsteller and
Charles Sandage who were actually in that business, and I didn’t know how
male-oriented that business was at that point. There were not very many
women other than secretaries in advertising.
Du: Going back a little bit to career aspirations, what were some of the career
aspirations of your friends and colleagues at Stanford?
Gianturco: Many of them wanted to be what women were assumed to want to be at
that point, and that was teachers. One of them went beyond the assumption
that girls would have to be nurses and was a doctor.
I graduated at a time when things were really beginning to shift. By
the early 1960s, the women’s movement had not yet gained real traction, but
it was starting.
[00:20:01] That was the first year that the Peace Corps accepted
volunteers, so I had several friends who went into the Peace Corps. One of
them was going to Thailand. One was going to Malawi. I thought that was
like going to Mars. I couldn’t imagine [travelling] that far.
Those women became professors, not just teachers. Already women
were beginning to push the barriers, the assumptions, and the discrimination
about what kinds of roles they could play.
Du: Do you think that was particular to just being on a college campus with
many very smart people, or do you think this was indicative of a larger shift
in attitude at that time?
Gianturco: I wasn’t yet aware of a larger shift, but I think that it was being seeded then.
I do know that my close friends and I had just read a book that came out
24

about that time called Mrs. Bridge [Evan S. Connell, 1959].
[00:21:08] Mrs. Bridge lived a life as a lonesome housewife stuck in
the center of the country raising a family, and ultimately her life was so
boring that she turned on her car in her garage and asphyxiated herself.
That story was horrifying. We vowed we would never lead that kind
of life. It would be unimaginable. So we promised each other, as if it were a
blood oath, that we would have interesting lives that didn’t consign us to
that kind of vapid existence.
Du: That’s amazing. I would also love to hear more about what you think the
impact of your education at Stanford was.
Gianturco: [00:22:01] I think that it sent me on a path, a lifelong path, with the
assumption that learning is simply part of life. I have either taught or taken
classes virtually ever since.
I have also maintained friendships from Stanford that are very
powerful and important to me, men and women who have been doing very
interesting things, causing change, breaking down barriers and breaking
glass ceilings, despite how hard it was. The glass ceiling was very much in
place in the 1960s when we graduated.
Du: [00:23:05] After you graduated, you started your career at Joseph Magnin.
Can you tell me a little bit about how you ended up there after you
graduated and what it was like to start working there?
Gianturco: I had an advisor at Stanford who miscalculated the number of credits I had,
so I graduated a quarter before anybody else [in the Class of 1961] was out.
I remember borrowing a car and driving to San Francisco to interview at
25

Joseph Magnin, which was a fashion-forward store--the first store in the
country to cater to working women.
[00:23:57] For some reason, in March or April of 1961, skirts went
from being mid-calf-length to way above the knees. [laughs] I thought, “I
only have things to wear that are mid-calf-length.” So I sat in the car in the
Union Square garage hemming my skirt and went in looking very chic in a
very short miniskirt.
I was interviewed immediately after another woman who was sitting
in the waiting room in the human resources department. She looked at my
hem, which I had caught, unbeknownst to me, with my heel as I got out of
the car. Half of it was hanging down and half of it was way up in the front.
She said, “Honey, your hem is falling out.”
[00:25:03] I said, “Oh, I know,” as if that were a normal thing.
[laughs] I was interviewed in this unlikely condition. Somehow, they thought
I should come and work there. [laughs]
I was a trainee for a year, and then I was very interested in going into
the advertising department, which was not the track that you were supposed
to follow. You were supposed to become a buyer. I decided to quit and go
to New York and be an interior designer, for which I was not at all qualified.
[laughs]
Cyril Magnin, who was the patriarch and founder of that chain of
stores, called me into his office. Their trainees did not leave after one year.
[00:26:03] He was so eccentric. He was lying on a slant board in his
office for this meeting. I walked in, and there he was with his head down
26

here. He said, “Why are you leaving?”
And I said, “Well, I’m going to New York to be an interior designer.”
He said, “If you were to stay, what would you like to do?”
I said, “I would like to be corporate public relations director.”
And he said, “Okay”--I knew that job was empty.
He said, “Okay. Can you write speeches for me?”
I said, “Sure.” I’d never written speeches for anybody.
“Can you write an annual report?”
“Of course.” I had never even read an annual report. But anyway,
here we were in this bizarre interview.
[00:26:48] He said, “Okay, you’re it. I’ll review it in three months.”
He never reviewed it. So I began my career with this lofty title. I started by
inviting the editors to have lunch with me and tell me what I could do to
help them. This seemed like a reasonable way to start if you didn’t know
anything about what you were supposed to be doing.
I did PR for seven years, and during that time JM expanded all over
Northern California, Southern California, and Nevada. It was really fun. I
was working with the news media. I was writing. I was supervising
photoshoots. I was hiring staff. I was also copying off press releases. I was a
one-person band, but it was fun.
Du: [00:28:04] Wow. When you first started at Joseph Magnin, how many people
were there? And by the time you ended, had it grown a lot during the time
you were there?

27

Gianturco: I can’t answer in terms of the number of people, because I don’t know
those numbers. They had maybe ten stores in Northern California when I
started, and when I left, they had maybe fifty stores in those states that I just
mentioned. They had grown a lot.
Du: That’s incredible. As the corporate public relations director, who did you
look up to in order to get advice for the job, or even just as a role model to
be a good leader for all the people you were leading?
Gianturco: I had to learn really fast. The editors educated me about the media relations.
I really hadn’t ever read an annual report, so I reached out to friends who
had gone to Stanford Business School and said, “Can you get me some
annual reports from the library?” I read them like crazy and then copied that
style.
[00:29:09] I was not formally mentored by anybody. I was just
looking everywhere for help, and I found it.
Du: I would love to go back to the moment you were in Cyril Magnin’s office
and said, “I want to be the corporate public relations director.” Where did
your ambition come from, and why do you think that you were given this
lofty position, especially as a young trainee?
Gianturco: Well, for one--I asked for it. The other thing that has held true my whole
life is that I love doing things that I haven’t done before. Later on, that
expanded to include things that nobody had done.
[00:30:01] I’ve always been really good at jumping into the swimming
pool and looking later to see if there’s any water in it [laughs]. It seems less
important to me [to feel totally prepared]--because I knew I could somehow
28

figure it out, whatever “it” was. I’ve done a lot of things that I’d never done
before and some that nobody had done.
Du: Can you give me an example of something that no one had done before
during your time at Joseph Magnin?
Gianturco: Well, I don’t think anyone who had been corporate public relations director
had been twenty-two. The woman who had had that job before me was
thirty-five, which seemed very old. She had come from Vogue Magazine.
She was so experienced, and she was British, which meant of course
that she sounded smarter than God. [laughs] Nobody expected someone my
age and without experience to do that job.
Du: [00:31:05] Wow, that’s wonderful. You mentioned that you spent seven
years at Joseph Magnin. What did you do after those seven years?
Gianturco: JM [Joseph Magnin] transferred me to Southern California because they
were expanding all over Southern California. That move put me back in
contact with a Stanford man whom I had dated many years before. He and I
got married, and I had a baby.
When my son was young, I worked one day a week for every year he
was old, because I had been hired by the first women-owned advertising
agency in the country--probably in the world. There were no other womenowned advertising agencies anywhere.
[00:32:08] I said to [the founders], “I really want to be at home when
my child is little.” They both had worked right through having children and
knew what a stretch it was and how it minimized the amount of time they
could spend with their children. They totally understood why I wanted [that
29

schedule, so] we made a deal that would work--and it was an amazing time.
No clients knew that I was [working part time]. I would talk to clients
from home. Working from home was not a known or expected role. I
would talk to clients from home when Scott [my son] was napping so that
they wouldn’t hear this crying baby in the background.
[00:32:57] I made up every excuse you can imagine. “I can’t come to
a meeting today. There are dinosaurs on the freeway.” [laughs] I had to
somehow pretend that I was working fulltime because nobody was working
from home.
At the end of the five years, I became a vice president of the agency
because I had worked so diligently. [Nobody knew] that I had been working
part-time.
Du: Can you tell me a little bit more about the challenges you faced when you
were doing this thing that almost no one else was doing, which was working
from home while also taking care of your child and also being really amazing
at your job?
Gianturco: I also started my own business at that same time. An artist in San Francisco
named Ruth Asawa was making dough cookie Christmas tree ornaments
and taught me how.
[00:33:59] I was making those for sale in my spare time, and on the
day--or two days, or later three days--a week when I was gone, I would have
the baby sitters paint my Christmas tree ornaments because I couldn’t get
behind. I had to [ship] them out on deadline for Christmas selling.
I was really working hard to keep my life full of productive projects.
30

There’s a lot of downtime when your baby is little. When your baby is
bigger, there’s a lot to do that is engaging and interesting, but at the
beginning there is not so much to do, so I was busily expanding my
horizons.
Du: [00:35:01] Was your husband working as well?
Gianturco: Rob [Sangster, my then-husband] was working as a lawyer in Los Angeles.
Du: What was it like having two working parents and managing a child? How
did you divide the responsibilities of raising your son with your husband?
Gianturco: He and I were married for only three years, and during those three
years--how can I explain this? As was true for virtually all of the women
whom I knew who were working, the women did two jobs.
They did their job outside of the home and they did their job inside
of the home. Men were not expected to participate in raising the child, or
cleaning, or cooking.
[00:35:56] My current husband [David Hill] is totally self-sufficient.
He does his own laundry; he does his own cooking. I traveled so much to
do all of these books over the last twenty-four years, but David wasn’t
bothered by that at all. He just continued doing what he had always done,
which was take care of his fair share of everything.
But in the late 1960s and early 1970s, that was not what men did.
They worked, and then they did other things that interested them. For Rob,
that was sculpture. But he certainly didn’t take care of the baby.

31

Du: Because that’s not what men did, did you have different expectations, or did
you take it upon yourself to work these two jobs and also do all these
other-Gianturco: I took it upon myself to do all those other things and work two jobs.
Du: [00:36:54] Wow. I’d love to talk about the period after you started your own
business and transitioned out of your job at Joseph Magnin. Where did you
go next?
Gianturco: I was hired by the first women-owned advertising agency, [Hall & Levine
Advertising]. That was what I did immediately after JM. That was really an
interesting experience because there were no precedents. We couldn’t look
to other women-owned businesses as models.
At one point, we had seventy-five women working together, and the
government told us that that was discrimination. We had to hire men.
[laughs] I am sure that didn’t happen to anybody else.
[00:38:00] Ultimately, [Hall & Levine] was acquired by Foote, Cone &
Belding, which was at that point a very large international agency. The
executives of our agency had to go through annual [executive physicals,
which included the things that Foote, Cone] would test men for, like
prostate cancer. We said, “Forget it.”
There simply were no patterns for having a women-owned business,
so we were making it up as we went along. We did some things that were
atypical.
`

The agency was located in midtown Los Angeles next to Lafayette

Park. We looked at this beautiful park and all of the apartments around it,
32

and we said, “This is a neighborhood where everybody is living in silos.
Why don’t we have lunch hour concerts and picnics in the park?”
We did that every month, once a month, and the people came out of
their apartment buildings and joined us. We arranged to have the Los
Angeles city music groups come and perform. It was great. Nobody else was
doing that, and as a result the neighborhood became a community, which it
hadn’t been before.
The law had just been passed [allowing] employee stock ownership
plans, ESOPs, and we in the management group of [Hall & Levine] decided
that we would have an ESOP, which meant that all of the employees got
stock in the company.
[00:40:11] [Everyone was] vested in the stock of Hall & Levine when
they came to work there. That was really atypical. I don’t know another
agency--or, in fact, another business--that was yet doing that.
The principals--I was not yet one, although I became one later--often
testified to the California Commission on the Status of Women because
women were so badly represented in advertising and communications at
that point. It was really shocking.
[00:40:57] We knew that women did not go to shop at Safeway, for
example, wearing their bedroom slippers [with their] hair in curlers pushing
a shopping basket around. I mean, that is dopey.
One of the real contributions that we could make to our clients--and
one of the reasons that clients came to us--was that we would represent
women with [respect and dignity in ads].
33

For example, we launched Neutrogena soap and understood the fact
that it doesn’t harm your skin, because it is a neutral soap. That was a very
scientific approach to selling soap. Everybody else was selling soap as a
beauty product.
[00:41:54] One of our clients was Catalina Swimwear and Sportswear.
During that time, women in swimwear ads were draping themselves
nonsensically across the hood of cars. What? [laughs]
We wrote poetry about being on the beach, and how free that feels.
Our ads didn’t look or sound like anybody else’s. We were really breaking
barriers in that way as well.
Du: The management team at Hall & Levine, including yourself, were they all
women? What was the gender ratio?
Gianturco: They were one hundred percent women for a long time.1
Du: [00:42:51] How do you think that your company and your work at Hall &
Levine changed the playing field for women not only at work, but also in
the way they were represented in commercials and in advertisements?
Gianturco: Our work was trendsetting. I was there fourteen years. By the end of that
fourteen-year period, we had lost our competitive advantage because other
agencies were getting better at understanding how to communicate to
women.
[As women became more and more central to the family spending
role], it was crucially important that everyone in advertising understood how
women made decisions and why.
1

Note from Paola Gianturco: Before the agency closed in 1981, there were two male vice presidents.
34

[00:44:04] I don’t know how much our agency was specifically
responsible for that shift, but we were definitely a participant in that shift.
Du: I have noticed a lot today how forward-thinking you are and how this has
been a trend since before you had even gone to college.
When you were working at Hall & Levine, were the other women
there very forward-thinking [and did they push] you to think a lot more out
of the box, too? Where did you look for inspiration during these very
innovative and ground-setting years?
Gianturco: [00:44:53] Hm. You’re right. We were doing things that didn’t provide us
with role models. I looked to Joan Levine and Adrienne Hall, who were the
founding partners. Joan Levine was particularly insightful about this. She
was the creative head of the agency.
I remember her talking with me at some length, on an ongoing basis,
about women and power. I was very fearful about assuming a powerful role,
because women were not supposed to do that. I was afraid of what I saw as
the necessary trade-offs between being feminine and being powerful.
[00:45:50] I remember Joan’s explaining specifically that power is not
something you wield over other people. Power comes from behind your
belt; that in fact you are powerful and that is a mode of being that you can
access and use. It was a completely different definition from what I had
assumed “power” meant.
It was really Joan and Adrienne who were my role models. Adrienne
was responsible for business development. That required a very assertive
stance. Ultimately, when I joined Saatchi & Saatchi, that was my role. She
35

managed accounts [at Hall & Levine]; I was ultimately an account strategist
[at Saaatchi and Saatachi].
[00:46:52] I learned things about business from Adrienne, and she
also led me into extracurricular activities that were really interesting. She
sponsored me to be a volunteer at the Los Angeles County Art Museum, for
example.
I volunteered in the Art Rental Gallery, which meant I got to go out
and visit the artists in Southern California who were really pushing
boundaries at that point.
The traditional definition of “artist” was exploded in the late 1960s
when Pop Art was happening. [laughs] I remember one exhibit in which
there was a big tub of bubbling mud.
[00:47:52] Collectors were just freaking out. The amount of money
they had poured into art for their walls was in danger, and there were all of
these strange things happening. I was part of that, in a way, thanks to
Adrienne.
There were many new things happening that were breaking down
traditions in the 1960s and 1970s. Although I wasn’t part of a hippie
commune--I was definitely part of groups of people who were thinking
beyond what was traditional.
Du: How do you think other people viewed you and the women that you were
working with?
Gianturco: [00:49:01] I think clients expected that we had some kind of secret inside
knowledge that they really needed. Clients were very respectful of us
36

because we were playing this role that provided services and perspectives
that were required to be effective and successful in business.
We had lots of applicants to be student interns, for example; women
applied to work with us, as opposed to applying to work in agencies that
were mostly populated by men. Girls and women both viewed us with a
great deal of respect and saw us as real trend-makers and tradition-breakers,
which was a happy circumstance.
[00:50:08] I would say to an applicant for a student intern job, “I will
trade you baby-sitting my son for working with me half a day at the agency
every week.” I would take all of my extra work home and teach her. We
were inventing weird solutions because, as I said, there wasn’t much
precedent.
Du: Did you mentor anyone during your time at Hall & Levine? What was that
like?
Gianturco: [00:50:47] Yes, I mentored this woman [Robin Ryan] I was just talking
about who came to work for us when she was a student at UCLA. She
ended up working for us when she graduated fulltime, and later became a
product manager for Bayer Aspirin and then later managed the McDonald’s
account in New York. While she was in Los Angeles, she continued to take
care of my son, who still considers her his big sister. Yes, I mentored lots of
people, both formally and informally.
Du: That’s amazing. I would love to transition now into your next job at Saatchi
& Saatchi. What did you do after your tenure at Hall & Levine ended, and
how did you find your way into Saatchi & Saatchi?
37

Gianturco: [00:51:52] The shift happened one morning during a Stanford reunion. I had
flown up to the Bay Area. I had been on my class’s twentieth Stanford
reunion committee. This must have been 1981.
My great friend from Stanford, Linda Clever, was a Stanford trustee
for a while and had been my friend from the beginning. She was president
and I was vice president of Roble Hall when we were sponsors.
Linda was giving a breakfast for some women in our class. My life
was falling apart in every way. The agency [Hall & Levine] was closing. I was
about to be divorced. Everything was up; all my roots were being pulled out
at the same time.
I walked into Linda’s house, and she said, “How are you doing with
your midlife crisis?”
[00:53:01] I said, “Well, it’s really a mess.”
She said, “What do you want to do?”
I said, “Well, I think I’d like to come back and work in Northern
California.”
She said, “Okay. I will introduce you to a friend of mine who runs an
advertising agency, and he can tell you who to interview with.” That was
David Hill, who has now been my husband for thirty years.
David had started a subsidiary of an agency that was ultimately
acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi. I joined his corporate communications
subsidiary as a result of Linda’s introduction. I was responsible for business
development, for supervising clients, and was a communications strategist
for nine years.
38

[00:54:08] We worked with corporate clients all over the country. We
had offices in San Francisco and New York. Suddenly I realized that I was
working almost exclusively with men.
Du: Were you living in New York now?
Gianturco: No, I was living in San Francisco, but working all over the country. My son
was then twelve or thirteen. I was doing daytrips all over the country so that
I could get back [home at night]. Oh my goodness, it was a crazy time. I was
working with Fortune 500 companies in Chicago, [New York, Denver…]
Du: I would love to have you explain more about what it was like to transition
into an almost exclusively male-dominated workplace.
Gianturco: [00:55:03] It was bizarre. Nothing about it was like working only with
women. The degree of constant competition was a real eye-opener. I had
come out of an environment in which collaboration was an assumption.
We competed at Hall & Levine with outside agencies for business,
and there was nothing wrong with our competitive bone, I assure you. But
we didn’t compete among ourselves. [The competitiveness] was a big
surprise. [00:56:03] The degree to which business socializing affected
business--whether on the golf course, in the men’s room, or other places I
wasn’t allowed--amazed me. [laughs] What was going on? There was no way
to figure out how to get into that circle.
I was sometimes the only woman in meetings for six months at a
time because I was very senior by this time, and I had been in this business
for years. I was admitted [to the inner circle], but in client meetings there
were no other women. They were outside the door someplace. That was a
39

big surprise.
[00:57:07] I met all kinds of men as new business prospects. Some,
trying to make friends with me, would tease me by mispronouncing my
name, which makes me crazy. I think men didn’t know what to do with me,
and I didn’t know what to do with them. It was like going to another planet.
Du: How do you think you were able to be successful in such an environment,
which was so different than what you were used to?
Gianturco: [00:58:01] I was very analytical and tried to figure out what the game was
that I didn’t know. I remember writing and delivering a speech called “Rules
of the Game,” which I had been invited to present at a women’s conference
[at Northwestern Michigan College].
I spilled the beans on what I thought were the assumptions. I
remember that I started by explaining that unless you were willing to lead
the orchestra, as opposed to just play in the orchestra, you lost and so forth.
[00:58:51] I gave that speech, and the Traverse City Record-Eagle, the
local newspaper--starving for news, no doubt--ran a banner headline about
my speech. Apparently, they felt very threatened because not only did they
use this as the lead story, but they also had a follow-on with man-in-thestreet interviews: “Gianturco says that this is how you should get ahead in
business. What do you think of that?”
The paper was swamped with letters to the editor because I had
[cracked the code]. The fabulous son of a good friend of mine, who
happens to live near Traverse City, wrote the paper and said, “I’ve known
Paola Gianturco since I was sixteen, and she has integrity and is worthy of
40

your respect,” and essentially, “Lay off.”
[01:00:04] It was wonderful. He was so young when he wrote this
letter. But his was almost the sole positive male voice in this onslaught of
attacks.
I had no idea this was going on. My friend Mary Sutherland wrote me
and sent me all of these articles, and I thought, “What?” I’m so glad I had
people defending me.
Du: What was this women’s conference? What was it for?
Gianturco: Northwestern Michigan College had a women’s studies program at that
point, and they were sponsoring a women’s executive leadership program. It
was run by my friend Mary Sutherland [who invited me to speak]. I said,
“Of course I’m coming.”
Du: [01:01:04] Who were the other women speaking at the conference?
Gianturco: I can’t remember. But I was definitely a voice in the wilderness. Oh my
goodness. [laughs]
Du: I’d love to go back to what you just said about your friend who vouched for
you at the time of this newspaper onslaught. During your time at Saatchi &
Saatchi, did you find other men who would vouch for your success and help
propel you?
Gianturco: When I was at Hall & Levine or when I was at Saatchi?
Du: When you were at Saatchi & Saatchi in this almost exclusively male
environment.
Gianturco: [01:01:52] Yes. One was David Hill. David Hill was president of the
subsidiary that I joined, and he introduced me to clients and new business
41

prospects with a flier that said, “POWOWLA.” [laughs] In fact, he later
made this [play on my name into a] pretend license plate, which made me
laugh. That flier introduced me with all of my professional credentials.
[01:02:43] He was a wonderful mentor. I had a really awful client
who, unbeknownst to me, took a commercial that we had created for them
and had it re-edited locally. I found out about that because I was there for a
client meeting and saw the commercial, which we had not made in that way.
It was awful.
I had no idea how to brook this discussion or to call out the client for
having double-crossed us, for having not been willing to discuss this with
us, and for having not been willing to cop to the fact that he was not happy
with what we had done. It was a revelation about the degree of trust that
didn’t exist, and I had no idea how to tackle that problem.
[01:03:55] I remember sitting with David, who coached me about
how to have that conversation. I said, “I’ve got to go and deal with this, but
I don’t have any idea how to.” He told me exactly how to do it.
He was really consistent in opening my eyes to this strange new
world that I was inhabiting, and that was a big help. He really was a
champion.
Du: That’s incredible.
Gianturco: He and I, however, came from very different worlds, so we had to work
hard to figure out how to balance the two and use both.
Du: What world did David come from?
Gianturco: Well, David had--his whole working life--worked mostly with men.
42

Du: [01:05:00] Were you ever in any situations in which people doubted you in
the professional workplace because of your gender?
Gianturco: I don’t think so, but here is a strange thing to confess. When my hair went
white, all of a sudden people listened to me. I always looked so young. I
don’t think it was a matter of gender but instead, a matter of looking like a
child for such a long time. [laughs] It was a hard-earned credential.
Du: [01:06:07] What do you think were some of your personal qualities and
characteristics that helped you be very successful and continue rising
through the ranks during your time at Saatchi & Saatchi?
Gianturco: I worked really hard. It was very important. The old saying is that women
have to work twice as hard as men do in order to be acknowledged as
accomplished. That really was true for me. I worked really, really hard.
Du: [01:06:57] And can you tell me about some of the most exciting campaigns
that you worked on during your time at Saatchi & Saatchi?
Gianturco: Boise Cascade was one of our clients. Public perceptions of corporations are
not positive in many ways, [but on top of that], Boise Cascade was a paper
company that cut down trees. They planted six trees for every one they cut.
we knew that; nobody else seemed to know that.
[01:07:54] [Positioning Boise Cascade] as a responsible corporation
was our charge. David was the creative director and we, as the strategic
communications team, thought that there was no way to make a claim about
[corporate responsibility] that would be convincing.
We recommended that Boise Cascade open up all of its plants to the
public and conduct tours of their forests so people could see. The
43

assumption was that people would then draw their own conclusions about
Boise’s corporate responsibility and that Boise’s actions would provide them
with a more positive reputation than anything we could claim and
communicate in advertising or commercials.
[01:08:58] It was a big deal to [open those plants to the public]. The
communications people approved it, and the CEO approved it. It meant
that all of the operating units had to open their facilities to the public.
The ad campaign that year featured children learning about
papermaking as a result of going on the tours. It was very unusual in the
world of corporate advertising, which tends to [make self-interested claims].
[01:09:47] I mean, listen to corporate advertising. Corporations
always talk about themselves. [laughs] They never have children talking
about them. They never are as transparent as we asked our client to be. It
was a campaign that really stood out then and in fact I think [it still would].
Du: I want to go back to your relationship with David. When did you get
married? Was this during your time at Saatchi or near the beginning?
Gianturco: I married David in 1988. I joined his company in 1981. He got divorced
about 1984 or 1985, and I suddenly realized that he was a man as well as my
boss.
[01:10:53] We had, by this time, figured out how to balance our
differences and use them. Each time we made a new adjustment, we grew
closer until suddenly we were nose to nose. So, we got married in 1988.
It was expected that we would talk with his boss, the president of
Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, and explain that we were going to get
44

married. Pete McSpadden said, “That’s okay. We can transfer Paola,”
because it was really unusual to have a husband and wife working together.
We had already talked to all of our clients. We said, “In the interest of
full disclosure, we are going to get married.” In fact, we invited them to our
wedding. It was really fun to have a wedding with all the clients there.
[01:12:01] There was nothing secret about this, and they knew that
we were a good team and that David was number one in the company and I
was essentially number two in the company.
But it was, nonetheless, atypical in 1988 to have a husband and wife
working together. We continued to work together until the mid-1990s. At
first, I was still working at Saatchi fulltime, and then later I started my own
consultancy and continued to work for some of the Saatchi clients. [The
mid-1990s] was a transitional time.
Du: When you were informing [everyone] that you and David were married and
the reaction was, “We can transfer Paola,” what was your response?
Gianturco: [01:13:04] David’s response was immediate. He said, “No, we’re not doing
that.” I didn’t even have to talk about it.
Du: Did you ever consider for a second that after you had gotten married you
would put a pause on your work and take a break? What were your thoughts
after you got married with regards to your career?
Gianturco: [Post-wedding, everything at work] was just the same. We were just married
as opposed to not having been married. David and I continued to be very
different in our approach to everything. Accountably, I will think X, and he
will think Y.
45

That continues to this day. I have finally come to understand that
listening to David’s ideas is a good thing to do. [laughs] Oh my goodness, it
took me a long time.
[01:13:59] We did a book together. The third book in my set of six is
a book that I didn’t expect to do, and I didn’t have time to do. I was already
working on another book. But I had this whole body of work [photographs
of Guatemala], and the publisher said they wanted to do a book [about that
country].
I said, “David, can you write this book? Use my pictures. Just take it
from here.” David had the idea that we would interview people in
Guatemala. We went to Guatemala and began doing the interviews.
Every question that I had was different from every question David
had. We were having a tug-of-war in these interviews. The interpreters
thought we were crazy. The people we were interviewing thought we were
crazy. We were mad. I was mad.
[01:14:54] David really upset the applecart. The book had already
been designed, and David said, “I think this should be a bilingual book.”
There was no space for a second language in this book.
I promised myself that I would listen to David’s ideas, and would not
respond for twenty-four hours. I walked all the way around that idea in my
mind, and suddenly I thought, “Oh my God, he’s right. The people in the
book should be able to read it. It should be in Spanish and English.”
The publisher had never done a bilingual book. I called the publisher,
who had already published two of my books, and said, “How would you feel
46

about redesigning this book?”
And they said, “Great, if you find the person to translate it, we’ll do
it.” It was a good idea. That was a good life lesson. [laughs] I had--until
then-- just come out fighting to defend my ideas, which I had learned was
part of the game.
Du: [01:16:09] I’d also love to hear about your time in business. During the
1960s, a lot of the women’s movement and the sexual revolution was
happening.
I was wondering how these outside influences affected your work,
the projects that you worked on for your clients, and the types of
advertisements that you were making for them.
Gianturco: I was reading all of the books at the beginning of the women’s movement,
but I wasn’t really engaged--none of us were really engaged in the women’s
movement.
[01:17:05] The [movement began] in academia and moved out,
thanks to Gloria Steinem, whom I knew as the founder of Ms. Magazine. She
came to pitch us to run ads in the magazine. I knew her as a professional
associate as opposed to someone who was running the movement.
In fact, Ms. didn’t want business from most of our clients because
[when they started] in 1972, they really wanted to focus on advertisers of
cars and products that were being sold mostly to men.
[01:18:04] They weren’t interested in [“women’s products” like]
Neutrogena soap, which was in the category of health and beauty aids. They
weren’t interested in Catalina Swimwear, which of course was categorized as
47

fashion. Our clients weren’t that interesting to them, but as a courtesy the
Ms. staff would come, visit us and pitch us to advertise in Ms.
That and testifying at the Status of Women Commission were the
activities that brought us closest to the [women’s] movement. I think that
women’s increasing awareness of their role and potential affected our clients
powerfully. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have come to us for this inside
knowledge that they assumed we had, and the fact is we did [have].
[01:19:06] [Most Hall & Levine women] were one hundred percent
focused on the business and on our families. We were a very tight, sort of
insular organization, worrying about how we could do our work well and
grow the agency at a time when the environment in which we were trying to
do that was at best polarized, and at worst not encouraging us to flourish.
We were very focused on our work and on our families.
Du: Earlier you mentioned testifying on the Status of Women Commission.
Could you talk about that more? What was that?
Gianturco: [01:19:57] I didn’t do that. Adrienne and Joan did that. There were new
government commissions on the status of women looking at [and exploring]
women’s issues. In general, discrimination against women was being
examined.
Du: During the time that you were working in business as well in the 1960s and
1970s, there were many gendered advertisements that were made and
targeted to women. Did you ever participate in making commercials
specifically for women? What was it like to participate in the making of
those sorts of advertisements?
48

Gianturco: [01:20:56] When I was at Hall & Levine, 100 percent of our work was
targeted toward women. Toward the end of my fourteen years there, we
actually had Subaru as a client because finally the car business was waking
up to the fact that women made decisions about buying cars. It wasn’t a
general fact [that was] accepted in the industry. [Manufacturers had
previously assumed that women decided the color of the cars families
purchased, but]…lo and behold!
Virtually all of our clients sold products to women, which is why they
came to us. For example, for niche foods, we introduced ramen in the
United States. We had kids [slurps] slurping noodles. As I mentioned, for
Catalina Swimwear we ran print ads with poems about being on the beach
and how great it is to be on the beach.
[01:22:26] Catalina had seventeen different divisions of men’s and
women’s sportswear and swimwear, and we did communications for all
seventeen divisions. Once we photographed them in Tahiti with UTA
French Airlines and the Tahiti Tourist Board as collaborative partners. We
were actually pitching both of those two clients for their business.
[01:23:05] The Tahiti Tourist Board said, “We’re hoping to grow the
black pearl business here because we have to offset the only source of
revenue we have--tourism. We’ve got to have something else. We’re going
to give you a bunch of black pearls. Put them on the models as you shoot.”
Well, you don’t exactly wear your best black pearls with your Catalina
T-shirt. [laughs] But we figured out how to [showcase the pearls]. The client,
a woman, and I got up at the crack of dawn [one morning and], with the art
49

director and the model, paddled out in an outrigger canoe to the reef that
surrounded Moorea, the Tahitian island where we were working.
[01:23:57] The idea was to have the model stand in her swimming
suit wearing a black pearl necklace, looking fabulous--standing, seemingly,
on the water--the reef, invisible, was one inch below [the water’s surface].
Suddenly the tide came in and upended the client, the model, and the
art director. It was amazing. I swam from the reef to the shore and said in
my best high school French, “We have a problem. Help us. Help us.” This
little kid whom I found on this shore jumped in his outrigger canoe and
helped everybody.
Before I swam ashore, I had gone diving for a plastic bag [that
contained] $150,000 worth of black pearls, which I had with me in my
canoe. I remember wondering if I should save the client or the pearls.
[laughs] What responsibility did I have?
[01:25:04] We were laughing. Did anyone know if workman’s
compensation covered drowning in the South Pacific? We had great
adventures making these commercials and these ads. Many adventures.
Du: Wow, that sounds incredible.

PAOLA GIANTURCO

INTERVIEWER:

MELISSA DU

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MAY 12, 2018

PART:

2 OF 3

Du: I’d like to jump back to the end of your tenure at Saatchi & Saatchi. What
was the transition as you were thinking about the end of your tenure? What
were you thinking about next?
Gianturco: I had--in a very sort of desultory way--been thinking about the possibility of
doing something else, because after you have done anything for what was
then almost thirty years, you lust after a change.
[00:01:02] But I had gotten nowhere in my thinking. I would walk
around on Mt. Tam [Mount Tamalpais] and think, “What next? What now?”
I was too senior to start again at the beginning. I had a reputation, and I was
well paid.
I couldn’t envision what a natural next step would be, and I walked
around the mountain and I walked around the mountain. I decided that I
would write a book about the glass ceiling.
[00:01:43] I realized that I knew a huge amount about working only
with women and then working only with men through my own life
experience, but that I had no sort of theoretical framework, no way to
51

generalize that experience. If I really wanted to do a book about the glass
ceiling, I needed to get up to speed.
I had the idea that I would use my one-month vacation--whoever has
time to take a one-month vacation? Nobody. Not me.
I thought, “I could use that time. I’ll take it in half-day increments and
go back to Stanford and take courses in women’s studies--” because nobody
was teaching women’s studies when I was there--and see if I can figure out
what I can say about the glass ceiling that might be of interest to people.
[00:03:00] I arranged to take Tuesday and Thursday afternoons off,
and I signed up for a number of courses over the next couple of years. I
didn’t care if they were undergraduate or graduate courses or continuing
education. I took all of them.
I took courses as diverse as “The Psychology of Women” and
“Women in Organizations” and “Women in Theology.” I didn’t care, and I
wasn’t taking any of these classes for grades, although I had to take the tests.
I really wanted to learn--and to be intentional about learning--about women’s
studies in general.
[00:03:55] Having access to the libraries was a big plus. When I wasn’t
taking classes those afternoons, I would go to the libraries and do research.
Suddenly I had access to all the libraries, which was fabulous. I could look at
trends that I suspected might be responsible for keeping the glass ceiling in
place historically. I could look for years either direction. I could look cross
culturally.
Ultimately, I identified eleven or twelve different factors that I
52

thought [contributed to keeping the glass ceiling in place]. I began plotting a
matrix of those factors.
Du: What were some of these factors?
Gianturco: [00:05:02] I was seeing trends in religions, for example. There are many ways
that religions are a factor in defining women’s potential roles plus what is
and isn’t acceptable in public and private life. Various cultures are
completely different in their views of women.
There are, of course, some matrilineal cultures still. I later discovered
that we really [should not want to live in] matrilineal cultures, any more than
in patrilineal cultures, or patriarchal, or matriarchal cultures. Anybody
wielding power over anybody else is, in general, a bad idea.
[00:06:03] I wanted to look at cultural differences because culture
definitely helps define women’s roles. I wanted to look at, anyway, many
different factors like that.
I never finished the matrix because I had a call from [a dean at] Mills
College, who had heard through some friend that I was working on this. She
asked if I would be interested in teaching a course about women and
leadership as a Mills executive course.
I said, “Phew, I just don’t have time to develop a course, but let me
think about it.” I realized that a friend who lived in the East Bay was
working also on issues about women and organizations, [and I thought she
might be willing to develop and teach this course] with me--and that it
would be fun to do it together.
[00:07:08] So we developed a course called Women and Leadership
53

and taught it at once at Mills. Friends at Stanford heard about the fact that
we were teaching there.
Now that I think about it, this may have even been Estelle [Estelle
Freedman], because I invited Susan Krieger, Estelle’s friend, to teach one of
those Mills classes with us. It might have been Estelle who was responsible
for Stanford’s invitation.
The director of what was then called the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender contacted me and said that they would like to [offer
our course as a summer] executive institute.2
[We taught Women and Leadership at] Stanford the next year and
taught that course, an eight-day seminar, four times. Some of the companies
that had sent women to that course--AT&T and Pacific Bell among them-asked us if we would teach the course onsite at their companies for Stanford
credit, which we did.
Within a very short period of time, maybe a couple of years, we had
taught that eight-day course twelve times on top of the consulting that I was
still doing all over the country.
[00:08:59] The effect of that was, [first] I was just exhausted. Second,
I had earned two years’ worth of money in one year because I was doing
two jobs. Third, I had a million frequent flyer miles. I could [fly anyplace
free] and stay anyplace free because hotels take frequent flyer miles too.
I began dreaming about not teaching about Women and Leadership.
I had now moved beyond the glass ceiling. The year 1995 was the year of
Editor’s Note: The Institute for Research on Women and Gender is now called the Michelle R. Clayman
Institute for Gender Research.

54

the Beijing conference--the UN’s Fourth World Conference on Women. I
was teaching at Stanford while that conference was going on.
All of us were watching what was happening in Beijing. We would
watch the news every night to see what was going on over there, and all of
us were very excited about it.
Du: This was a world conference?
Gianturco: [00:09:55] This was the UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing,
and there were something like 30,000 people there, women who were
involved with NGOs, women who were involved with the UN. They were
focused on women’s issues exclusively.
One of the pieces of research that was released there--I read about it
in The Economist --was that women in the developing world were sending their
children to school with the money they earned. In many cultures men were
given the prerogative to spend the money they earn on whatever they want:
bicycles, beer, radios. Not yet cell phones, but later cell phones. And women
inevitably were the ones who were left with the responsibility for feeding and
educating the children. I thought, “My God, the [women] are heroic.”
[00:11:02] This was also at the time that women were beginning to
start their own microbusinesses using microloans, although-Du: And this is in the United States?
Gianturco: Outside of the United States. Although no one was yet much talking about
microloans.
I thought, “I would love to go and talk with these women who are
starting their own businesses”--because my whole life had been in large
55

corporations--“and see what it’s like for them.”
I also wanted to document the fact that they were essentially taking
on responsibility for the next generation and affecting not just their families,
but their communities and their countries and all of us.
[00:11:51] I had this germinal idea about what I wanted to do at that
time. First of all, I decided I would take one year off, as a sabbatical. I knew
people who took sabbaticals. I said goodbye to the clients, and I promised
myself [that while I was on sabbatical] I would only do what I loved most,
which was photography and travel. I had learned photography from my
father. He put a camera in my hands when I was eight. I was not a
professional photography by a longshot.
I promised myself I would do, in addition to things I loved the most,
what I wanted to learn next, which was about women starting their own
businesses. [00:12:51] That turned out to be the first book. I thought it
would be simple to do a photographic book, and that I didn’t have to be a
writer, which I wasn’t. I could just do photo captions. I had taken pictures
for a long time. I assumed I could take pictures.
Nobody had done any photo books about women around the world
at that point. I had always collected folk art, as you can see. I thought, “I
have to know something about what I’m doing here, so I’m going to focus
on craftswomen starting their own businesses in order to send their children
to school.”
[00:13:57] That turned into the first book, which is called In Her
Hands: Craftswomen Changing Our World. That was a labyrinthine, transitional
56

time. I didn’t at any point say to myself, “I’m going to stop being in
business, and now I’m going to do books.” But as you can see, I just sort of
eked into it, finding my way as I went.
Sometime during that year--I was traveling--I was driving across the
breadbasket of Bolivia, having interviewed women all day. I was standing in
the back of a Toyota pickup truck taking pictures as the sun went down.
It was so glorious. I thought, “I have never had so much fun in my
working life as I did today. I’m not going back to business.” And I didn’t.
Du: [00:14:59] Wow. I would love to go back to when you decided on the idea for
In Her Hands for your first book. What were your next steps? What did you do
after you got the idea? How did you learn what making a book was like?
Gianturco: By doing it. [laughs] I had no idea even what I had to learn. I thought I had
everything I needed to know--oh my God, it was so much more
complicated than I knew.
What I knew was that I wanted to interview craftswomen, and so job
one was trying to find craftswomen to interview. I used all of the
connections with everybody I had ever known to find those craftswomen
[plus connections from] people I didn’t know.
[00:15:58] I would walk into stores and see things made in other
places. I would ask the people [who owned the store] who they bought the
objects from. How did they get them? Who made them? Where were they?
I spent a week doing research in the library at the International
Museum of Folk Art in Santa Fe--I explained to them that I wanted to do a
book about craftswomen making crafts that were considered “women’s
57

crafts.”
They said, “Well, that’s very interesting. Nobody has ever done a
book exactly like that.”
I said, “Oh, good.” So the curators of the museum began bringing in
books they had about crafts that were being made by women. It turned out
that crafts are segregated by sex; there are crafts that only men do and only
women do.
[00:17:01] For example, women tend to do weaving with back-strap
looms or simple looms, and men tend to do weaving with foot looms or
mechanical looms. As soon as there is a way to mechanize the production,
men step in because [they see that there is money to be made].
Women tend to do [weaving] by hand. This is also true of ceramics.
For example, women tend to do ceramics made by [rubs hands together]
rolling clay in their hands, by the coil method, and men tend to use pottery
wheels. Now more [men and women] do both.
There really were women’s crafts. That’s what I wanted to feature in
In Her Hands, which meant doing a lot of work trying to figure out which
were women’s crafts--and where were the women’s crafts made.
[00:18:07] I discovered when I talked with women rug weavers in
Turkey that they were laughing because they had just been to some kind of a
weaving conference, and there were Iranian men making rugs. They couldn’t
believe men were making rugs in Iran. That’s women’s work.
So that first book was really a project that explored much more than
just the idea that women were raising their children and educating them, but
58

also looked at these collateral gender issues about women and crafts.
Do you want to see that book? I’ll show you that book. I invited a
friend to do that book with me. [sounds of a book being picked up] Ta-da.
Du: [00:19:04] Wow.
Gianturco: I must have used this for something. This was a library copy that I bought.
Anyway, it was a really pretty book.
Du: This is incredible.
Gianturco: Toby Tuttle, who was my coauthor, was a woman whom I had hired at Hall
& Levine. She wasn’t a photographer or a writer, either. So we were both
helping each other and totally at sea. [laughs]
Du: How did you ask her to come onto this project with you?
Gianturco: Her husband had almost as many frequent flier miles as I had, and I said,
“Do you think Tim would give you some frequent flier miles, and would
you like to do this book with me?”
[00:19:57] Both of us took the photographs, and both of us did the
writing. We went to twelve countries and interviewed ninety craftswomen
about their work and their children. So that was the beginning.
I must say it wasn’t as easy as that. [laughs] It sure was fun to travel
around. We had a great time--met people and loved talking with women
around the world.
Oh, another thing I did--before I leave the preparation stage: I found
an anthropologist who had written about crafts, particularly about rug
weavers, who taught at Indiana University. I went there and interviewed him
because I was worried about [whether the women] would tell me anything
59

about their lives.
[00:21:09] I mean, I am not from their culture. For sure, I am better
educated than they are because most of the craftswomen were illiterate.
People think there is gold in the streets of the United States. So if you say,
“This American is coming to interview you,” that isn’t exactly like an
introduction to your next-door neighbor.
I thought, “I really have to talk to somebody who’s done a lot of
work in these cultures who can tell me how to do these interviews.” That
was another aspect of the preparation.
Du: How did you find him?
Gianturco: Reading, as always. Reading, reading, reading. He said, “Sit down next to her
at the loom and ask her what she’s doing and be interested in her work.” I
was used to marketing research. That’s not where you start! [laughs]
[00:22:09] [Marketing research] turned out to be, by the way, a
pernicious legacy. I had written 116 questions that I was going to ask each
woman because I was determined that the input from each country would
be identical so that I could draw some cross-cultural conclusions.
Try doing an interview in which you’re using a translator for every
question and every answer--and you have to get to 116 questions. You can’t
do that. Also, [that approach] overlooks the potential for really rich stories.
You can’t veer off and follow the lead of the person you’re talking to. You
are stuck with this list of 116 questions. That was a lesson.
Du: [00:22:59] What were some of the questions on that list?

60

Gianturco: I wanted to know everything: how did they learn their crafts, how did they
meet their husband, how many children did they have. It went on and on
and on.
I learned very quickly that if you’re interviewing in Muslim countries
and they have to pray every four hours, [laughs] you get interrupted, and
then you get interrupted again. It takes forever. You can’t do that. There
were many things for me to learn!
Du: Can you go back and tell me more about how you found these women as
you were preparing back in Santa Fe? You were doing a lot of research in
the library. How did you find women in these countries, and how did you
get in contact with them?
Gianturco: I would walk into stores and see folk art and say, “Who made that, and
where did you buy it?”
[00:23:54] I learned about an organization called the Crafts Center,
which is a nonprofit no longer in existence, but used to work with lowincome artisans in seventy-nine countries. I went and talked with them and
said, “You work with low-income artisans in seventy-nine countries. Tell me
who’s doing the most interesting work.”
I talked to friends and scholars who were working in art and knew
about crafts. I talked to people in museums. I talked to everybody I knew
who ever bought crafts.
Finding twelve locations was a snap. The hardest thing was to pare it
down to twelve. I finally figured out how to balance the kind of crafts and

61

the geographies and the ethnicities and all of the things that I wanted to
have balanced in the book.
Du: [00:25:08] Can you also tell me more--especially because this was your first
book--about how you learned to do professional photography and also
about writing the book? What was it like to learn these [skills], and what
were some of your challenges?
Gianturco: [laughs] Oh my goodness. We had a fabulous book designer, but if you look
at the photographs in In Her Hands, the fact is that these are not very snazzy
photographs. [sounds of pages turning]. [Mostly portraits].
[00:26:01] I looked at these pictures after the book came out, and I
thought, “You know what, I could have practically taken these pictures in
my living room. You don’t have any sense of where you are.” I thought, “I
have really got to learn how to expand my vision to include environments.”
[The problem was, I was very nearsighted].
[00:27:01] After this book came out and I thought, “This was so
much fun. I want to do more books.” [My next] thought [was], “I have got
to learn to be a better photographer.”
I began taking classes from National Geographic photographers who
were teaching both at the Santa Fe Photographic Workshops and at the
Maine Photographic Workshops--which are now called the Maine Media
Workshops.
Those were one or two-week courses with these superbly qualified
photographers who work all over the world and who understand how to
work all over the world, which is what I needed to know in addition to how
62

to do the taking-pictures part.
I took probably seven or eight of those workshops from people who
were really luminous at this kind of photography, people like Alex Webb,
David Alan Harvey, Bill Allen, people whose work I really admire.
[00:28:10] I learned a huge amount. These are very demanding
teachers and very small groups of photographers, most of them professional
photographers.
I learned the most from Alex Webb, who is known for very
complicated photography that is intricately composed in layers. For
example, if you were taking a picture of me, you might start by including the
microphone and then me and what’s behind me, and you would expect
something interesting to be happening at all of those levels.
[00:29:01] This was visually a huge challenge for me because, as I
said, I’m so nearsighted that I focus on you and nothing else. It doesn’t
matter what’s behind you. It doesn’t matter what’s in front of you, much
less what’s to the side you.
I worked with Alex Webb in Cuba for a ten-day workshop. I set my
camera to wide angle, and I set it on a very small aperture, which meant
everything would be in focus all the way back through all of those layers.
I forced myself to learn how to see a different way. I looked at those
first pictures, and I thought, “Who took these?” because it required a
completely different perspective from what I had.

63

Du: [00:30:04] Can you talk a little bit more about this different perspective?
What does it mean to see more in different layers beyond just what’s in
front of you?
Gianturco: Well, it’s much more complicated. It makes it possible to tell a story
contextually as opposed to simplistically focusing only on the person.
I might now shoot you at this moment in a way that would allow the
viewer to see the bookcase behind you and the photographs on the wall and
the little foreign dolls to your right, and suddenly I would have a sense of
Melissa in context, which would be more information than I ever had in the
photographs that were in In Her Hands.
[00:31:18] [My pictures are] much richer now. It is very, very hard to
do multiple-layer compositions. I have never really mastered that. I continue
to work on it. I will never be anything close to as good as Alex Webb, but I
continue to admire his work more than anyone else’s.
Du: What are some of the challenges of multilayer photographs?
Gianturco: [00:31:59] It requires sitting and waiting. Let’s pretend we’re out on the
street. I want people walking behind you and in front of you and reflected in
the window, and I want that composition to be important and engaging at
all of those levels.
I have to wait for something like that to happen. These images are
not posed. And you have to have a very acute eye and a very fast finger,
because it may be that that kind of composition happens once in twentyfour hours. [laughs]
[00:32:44] You really have to be consistently aware and intentional
64

about what you’re photographing. It’s not just capturing a moment. It is
capturing one moment that is composed at all of the layers that you’re
including in the frame. Try it. It is amazingly difficult.
Du: And I’d also love now to talk a little bit more about the text of In Her Hands.
How did you learn to write for this book?
Gianturco: Since I’m married to a writer, you would think that I might have said,
“David, help me learn how to write.” I was so shy about my writing that I
never let David read anything except the introduction to that book and only
after I had sent it already to the publisher.
[00:33:57] I joined a writing group in San Francisco. It was run by a
fabulous writer, a Turkish woman who wrote screenplays and nonfiction
and fiction and fables and children’s stories. Her name is Alev Lytle
Croutier. She’s very talented.
She had a women’s writing group that met every Tuesday, and I
would busily write for a week and then take what I had written and read it
out loud. The people who were in that group ranged from poets to lyricists
to a woman writing erotica. There were eight of us, all writing completely
different genres. Most of them were published; not me.
[00:34:52] I could somehow--in that emotionally-neutral
environment--gather my courage and read what I had written that week.
Because there was continuity, participants had a sense of the whole project
by the time I got to the end.
I should say: I did all of this writing and all of this photography

65

before I had a publisher, much less an agent, much less any of the things
that are required to do and have before you get to either one.
Du: What did this mean for the journey of you making In Her Hands?
Gianturco: It meant the book got completely made before I was sure it was going to be
seen by anybody. [laughs] I didn’t think about that--I was so busy making it.
I mean, it was a lot of work to do this.
[00:35:53] I got to the end of it. Toby and I were having breakfast
someplace in Bolivia. We were still shooting. She said, “Paola, what would
you do if this didn’t get published?”
I was just stunned. This was an affront from my great friend and
coauthor. I said, “What do you mean, ‘not get published?’ Of course it will
get published.” I don’t know what magic I had in mind. [laughs]
It turned out there was a whole lot to be done. I needed an agent
first. I wrote proposals and sent them to seventeen agents. Nobody told me
that there are agents for text-only books and agents for photography books.
Completely different businesses.
A couple of the text-only book people said, “Well, if you just drop all
the photographs, I would be happy to represent you.” And I thought, “Are
the photographs that bad?”
[00:36:56] Happenstantially, I had also written to agents who
represent books in the photography book industry, which usually have
almost no text--some, but never as much as my books. They would say,
“Well, if you drop all of the text, we’d be happy to represent you.”
I thought, “What is going on?” Finally, Alev, the woman was running
66

my writers’ group, said, “Do you have an idea of what you want your book
to look like?”
I said, “Yes, I want it to look like Painted Prayers,” which was created
by an anthropologist photographer named Stephen Huyler.
Alev said, “Well, I know Stephen. Would you like to talk to him?”
Changed my life. Stephen turned out to be generous-spirited and spent
three hours on the phone to me explaining how to do everything,
introduced me to his agent, introduced me to his PR person--has become,
since, a fantastic friend.
[00:37:59] I then talked to his agent, who was also a packager--people
who put books together, and then give the whole package to the publisher. I
said, “Judith [Judith Joseph], what do I need to do?”
She said, “Well, for one thing, you need to get a museum exhibit.”
I said, “Well, my photographs have never been exhibited anywhere,
[laughs] nowhere, no galleries, not even by a PTA [Parent Teacher
Association]. Nobody has ever shown my pictures.”
She said, “Well, you should have a museum exhibit, and you should
have somebody writing the foreword who will be well-reputed and wellknown to publishers because your name is unknown plus
unpronounceable.” [both laugh]
[00:38:55] As you can see, the cover says, “Foreword by Alice
Walker.” Judith arranged that. I said, “Judith, I don’t know anybody famous.
I know no famous people.”
She said, “Make a wish list of people you would consider having
67

write this, and we’ll talk about it again.” I made a long list--a long, long list-of people, none of whom I knew. And she said, “I’ll take it from here.”
She sent Alice Walker the galleys of the book after we had a
publisher. Judith had promised the publisher that the foreword would be
written by somebody everybody had heard of. Alice Walker said she would
love to write it--if I gave two hundred dollars to one of the groups in the
book. Fantastic.
Du: Who is Alice Walker?
Gianturco: [00:39:52] Alice Walker wrote The Color Purple, and she is an extremely wellknown feminist fiction author and writer and lives in the East Bay. So having
her involved was a big plus.
I knew how to write proposals, so I began writing proposals to
museums and just sent them to, maybe, fifty museums. I thought, “All they
can say is no.”
Lo and behold, the Field Museum in Chicago, which is the oldest
museum in the country--a science museum that includes anthropology--said
they would like to do an exhibit about In Her Hands. Heaven.
[00:41:04] We now had fulfilled the two requirements that publishers
require. Judith had been in the business for a long time--she herself had been
a publisher and knew all the publishers. Within a week, we had three offers
from publishers in New York.
Toby and I flew back and talked with them and agreed to work with
[one of those three]. The publisher then said, “What kind of promotion do
you plan in addition to this exhibit?”
68

[00:41:42] We said, “None.” [laughs] So Judith, wearing her PR hat,
called Oprah and continued to call the secretary who answered the phone
once a week for God knows how many weeks, having explained to her,
“Listen, my job here is to get my client on the Oprah Winfrey show. Expect to
hear from me every once in a while, and we’ll be fast friends by the time we
get to the end of this.”
She just basically kept calling and calling and calling and calling and
calling. Separately: Oprah, who at that point had never done any shows about
international women, decided to do three.
Oprah was newly engaging with women around the world and
considering the possibility and had not yet opened her girls academy in South
Africa. But she was beginning to consider issues that had to do with women
around the world.
[00:42:56] In the third of the three of that series, Oprah had the idea
that the Spirit segment, which was a five-minute segment at the end of the
show, would be about In Her Hands, and the rest of the segment would be
about FGM--about female genital mutilation. We didn’t know that yet. We
didn’t know what the rest of the show would be about.
We didn’t ever meet Oprah. She sent her crew [to my house]. They
photographed for a full day, interviewing Toby and me for this five-minute
segment.
In Her Hands is a seventy-five-dollar book. The poor publisher was
asked to give Oprah three hundred copies of this book, which is a huge dent
in a small publisher’s budget. But he swallowed hard, and they put a copy of
69

In Her Hands under every seat in the audience of the show.
[00:43:57] I invited Alev, my writing teacher, and my whole women’s
writing group to my house for a tea party and to watch The Oprah Show,
which ran on a Friday at 4:30 in the afternoon--or something like that.
The sales rank of In Her Hands on Amazon that Friday morning was
something like 160,000. It was not exactly a hot item.
The show ran. I remember watching it, and there were pictures of
these little girls getting carried out of tents, having just been cut, crying. It
was just heartrending. I thought, “How can the Spirit segment ever lift
anybody’s spirits after this?”
[00:44:54] We got to the Spirit section, and there was Oprah sitting in
front of a photograph of the front cover of the book that must have been
twenty feet tall, and she talked all about how wonderful this book was. They
ran the Spirit segment. Then she announced that there was a copy of the
book under everybody’s chair. The audience cheered. It was amazing.
I looked at the sales rank on Amazon at the end of this show, and it
was 128, and the next morning it was 74. I did nothing for two weeks except
answer e-mails from people I never heard of about this book, and it sold out.
Du: That’s amazing.
Gianturco: It was totally amazing. Here I had worked for all these years to make this
book, which sold out. Oh my goodness.
[00:45:53] This publisher that I had been working with didn’t do
paperbacks. Judith, the agent, and I began talking with people who did do
paperbacks and found powerHouse Books, and they agreed to do a
70

paperback version of In Her Hands.
Judith, being a smart agent, wrote into my contract that powerHouse
had the right of first refusal on any of my future books. All of my other
books have been published by powerHouse Books.
Du: What does this right of refusal mean?
Gianturco: It means that you, the author, present them with a concept for a book, and
they say, “We will, yes, publish that,” or, “No, we won’t.” They have decided
to publish all of the rest of my books; there have now been five more.
Du: How long did you work on In Her Hands before publishing?
Gianturco: [00:46:49] We did the test shoots in Turkey and Poland in 1996--maybe the
end of 1995, early 1996. The book was published in 2000. It wasn’t the oneyear sabbatical that I had imagined. [laughs] I am now in my twenty-fourth
year of my one-year sabbatical.
Du: That’s so incredible to hear. During In Her Hands, you visited all these
twelve countries. Do you have any standout experiences that you remember
that you would like to share from these countries?
Gianturco: Hm. Well, we learned a huge amount as we went along. For example, the
first place we went was Poland. I had imagined this book would feature one
craftswoman per chapter.
[00:48:02] We got to Zalipie. Zalipie is a tiny village in southeastern
Poland, and it took hours to find it. We went through farms. It was near
nowhere. What drew me there was that the women painted the walls of their
houses and the outside of their houses and everything else, including
firetrucks, with flowers. How wonderful. This is a place where wildflowers
71

grow everyplace. The women began by making the sooty walls of their
houses look less awful by painting dots of white and then making flowers
around those dots.
[00:48:59] They now make very intricate flower designs, and they
embroider flower designs on everything that they don’t paint. It’s just an
amazing place if you like the idea of craftswomen and floral designs.
We finally arrived there late, at the end of the tea party that they had
planned to greet us. I said, “Which one of you”--there were twelve of them
in the room--“Which one of you shall we interview tomorrow?”
They said, “One?”
“One.”
“Well, maybe if we have to pick one, maybe Sophia. She has the best
kitchen.” [laughs] And I thought, “What does that have to do with
anything?”3
[00:49:48] It became immediately clear that craftswomen in Poland-and many other countries--work in groups. They thought we were crazy.
They thought, “Why would you ever just want one?” There was so much to
be learned. Oh my goodness.
There was no place to stay in Zalipie, not surprising, so they arranged
to put us in the infirmary at the grade school. [laughs] So if you wanted to
go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, you had to run all the way
down the corridors to the little girls’ room with the little tiny potties.
We were with the interpreter, each of us in one of these hospital beds
3

Note from Paola Gianturco: Sophia’s kitchen was covered with painted flowers!
72

in the infirmary. A mouse ran in, and it turned out that that the interpreter,
who worked for the Peace Corps, was terrified of mice. [laughs] [00:50:56]
We had this trauma in the middle of the night with her standing in her
hospital bed yelling because the mouse was running around. Oh my
goodness, there were so many adventures it was just crazy--all of them
learning experiences.
We ended up with groups of craftswomen, not just one craftswoman,
per chapter. I learned fast to drop that 116-question business and ask sort of
informal conversational questions and then follow up and let the person
whom I was interviewing lead me. There was much to be learned.
Du: Wow, that’s incredible. In Her Hands is now published, and it’s sold out.
Incredible.
[00:51:58] How did you begin thinking of your idea for a second
book? Did you think that you would make one? How did the idea come?
Gianturco: One of the chapters in In Her Hands is about women in India, way out in the
desert, who make mirror embroidery. I really enjoyed being with these women
in Gujarat.
As I was packing up my cameras, one of them said, “Come back in the
fall, and we will teach you the dances that we dance all night to honor the
mother god.”
I said, “You do? I am coming.” That gave me the idea that even though
women are discounted and demeaned in cultures all over the world, there are
also festivals that celebrate women, their spirituality, their accomplishments,

73

and their roles, and that nobody had ever documented that. I decided that my
next book would be about festivals that celebrate women.
Du: [00:53:19] How did you pursue this idea? What were your first steps?
Gianturco: Well, I had one in the bag, because I knew that I was going back to India to
document the festival that celebrated the mother god, which turned out to
be the Durga festival. Very quickly I learned that there is also a Kali festival,
also in India. Kali follows on Durga by three or four weeks.
[00:53:59] How did I find these festivals? Well, I should back up and
say that still preparing to do In Her Hands, I had read that authors have two
years from the time you find a publisher and the book gets designed and
printed, probably overseas, and shipped back.
You may have two years to establish your credentials in this subject
you have written about--the Stanford people who are listening to this are
going to die, because they think they have to study their whole lives in order
to accrue enough knowledge to write [a credible book].
I had read that you have two years maybe to establish your
credentials in this field. [laughs] I thought, “Wow, I’d better get on it,
because of course I have no credentials in this field, women and crafts.”
[00:55:04] I told you I had gone to the Crafts Center in Washington,
DC, to do some research. I joined the Crafts Center as a member and then
used that leverage to talk to the director. I said, “Have you ever done any
marketing research about your members? Do you have any idea what they’re
interested in, and are you satisfying that interest?”
She said, “Well, we don’t know. We have never--”
74

I said, “Let me design a marketing research study for you; I will
conduct it and I will write you a business plan.” I was, within about six
months, on their board, and ultimately I became chairman of that board.
Guess what? By the time the book came out, I was chairman of the Crafts
Center. [both laugh]
[00:55:56] I did something else. I joined the Association of Women in
Development, a luminous international organization that looks at women in
the developing world mostly--it now has renamed itself the Association of
Women’s Rights in Development.
I said, “Have you ever done any research about your members? Do
you know what they’re interested in, and are you satisfying those interests?”
And they said, well, no, they hadn’t done that.
I just modified the study I had designed for the Crafts Center, and we
fielded it for the Association of Women’s Rights in Development. I
analyzed and wrote up the results and wrote a business plan for them.
Guess what? I was now on their board.
[00:56:51] And by the time the book came out, I had both of those
credentials, and those were wonderful avenues to explore for all of the rest
of the books. [To get back to women’s festivals], I found ideas through
those associations because these are people who are very deeply engaged
with women in other cultures.
Du: Wow, that’s incredible.

STANFORD ALUMNI INTERVIEWS - PIONEERING WOMEN

INTERVIEWEE:

PAOLA GIANTURCO

INTERVIEWER:

MELISSA DU

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MAY 12, 2018

PART:

3 OF 3

Du: For your second book, Celebrating Women, where did you get the idea, and
how did you get started? Can you tell me a little bit about the beginnings of
this book and starting to work on this project?
Gianturco: Well, I told you a little bit about how this book started. It started when the
women in India whom I had photographed for In Her Hands invited me
back for the Durga festival. I began to discover that there were festivals all
over the world that celebrate women for completely different reasons,
sometimes for their spiritual lives, sometimes for their accomplishments,
sometimes for their roles.
[00:00:49] But what captured my attention was that nobody was
writing about this. Women are so often denigrated in different cultures, but
sometimes those very same cultures also celebrate them, and sometimes
cultures where women are revered also celebrate them.
For example, I went to the northeastern corner [of India] and visited
a city named Shillong. The Khasi tribe lives in that area. The Khasi tribe is
matrilineal. They celebrate the harvest festival, which honors the feminine
77

and fertility. [Both men and women] wear fabulous costumes and do
amazing dances honoring women. And they do animal sacrifice.
[00:02:00] Something very interesting happened. I interviewed the
head of the men’s liberation movement. I have never been anyplace else
where I found one. I said, “Well, I want to talk to the head of it.”
I interviewed the man, who explained that the children take the
mother’s family name--not the father’s. He felt so strongly that his own
children should have his name that every time they brought home a report
card, he would erase the wife’s family name off the report card and put his
family name on the report card.
What he never knew--he may not know it yet--is that his sister-in-law,
who worked at the school, waited until the report cards came back, erased
his name every time, and put her family name back in place.
[00:02:50] But something very serious has happened, which is that
the men, who used to be the protectors and defenders, now have no role.
The women are so strongly in charge of this society that the men are
[finding solace in] taking drugs and having real alcohol problems, and the
women don’t want to marry them. It’s likely to be the end of the tribe.
Du: Where is this tribe located again?
Gianturco: Shillong, India.
Du: Tell me more about the men’s liberation movement.
Gianturco: There were about two thousand men who had gathered together to protest
this terrible situation.

78

Du: This was something that you witnessed when you went to India to do the
first project.
Gianturco: No, [I went there for my second book, Celebrating Women. To document the]
celebration of the harvest and fertility and the women. In the course of
interviewing the women, [I] discovered that this men’s liberation movement
existed. I’m a reporter. I’ve always wanted to look at both sides of
everything. So I said I wanted to talk to him.
[00:04:02] It really portends badly when either men or women hold
the power, as I had also seen in the Shipibo culture in Peru, which I visited
for my first book. That’s a matrilineal culture as well, and I asked the
women I was interviewing, “What is domestic violence like here?”
The one woman said, “Oh, we beat up the men.” There has to be a
different way to go about this.
Du: Yes. As you were looking for more stories for your second book, what were
some other places that you visited, and what did you see?
Gianturco: [00:04:54] Well, let me see what I can describe to you. Oh, I went to the
West Indies, the feast of the cooks. This is a festival in which the women
cook feasts and feed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
traditional foods that are part of their culture.
I was in Sweden for Santa Lucia, which is the December holiday that
celebrates the saint, St. Lucy. Girls wear candles on their heads and sing. It
is so dark in Sweden then. I have never appreciated so much the fact that
photography is the art of light because everything was lit either by
candlelight or so dark that I couldn’t even shoot. At noon, the sun came up
79

about that much. It was like a shade going up at the horizon, and then it
came right back down twenty minutes later. It was an amazing experience.
[00:06:12] I was in Spain for a festival that celebrates life under the
guise of celebrating death. This is a festival that honors the saint, [Santa
Marta de Ribarteme]. People give thanks to her [because they are] alive after
having had a near-death experience during the year. The men and women
who have had that experience are carried in open coffins--around the town
to give thanks to Santa Marta for the fact that they are alive.
[00:07:03] In Morocco, they have a festival in which the women ask
the men to marry them. One day a year this happens. The women ask the
men to marry them, and then they are married en masse.
There are many different kinds festivals that [celebrate] women.
Du: What was the process of finding these festivals like, and how did that differ
from your experiences finding the craftswomen from your first book?
Gianturco: The process is almost always the same. It takes almost a year to do the
research for these projects, and it’s a matter of reaching out to all kinds of
people and trying to find the most interesting stories.
[00:07:59] It was essentially the same process that I described before.
That has gotten easier as I’ve done more and more books because finally I
have a network that I can count on. But I didn’t at the beginning. I just was
searching, searching.
Du: I noticed that this book is a solo project whereas your first one was a joint
project with Toby Tuttle. Was it different working on this yourself and
going to the countries by yourself or not having a fellow-80

Gianturco: I had expected it would be [different]. When I started In Her Hands, I
assumed that being a woman traveling alone was a fairly dangerous thing to
do. I didn’t know how people in other cultures would view that.
[00:08:51] As it turned out, I needn’t have worried about that because
the groups I was visiting--the people whom I was interviewing--really sort of
adopted me. So I’ve never felt as if I were traveling alone or as if it were
dangerous. So I decided to proceed [with the next book] alone.
Du: What do you mean by “adopted”? Did they invite you into their homes?
Gianturco: Oh, for sure. I was always in people’s houses. I always do the interviews, if I
can, in people’s houses. But all of my book experiences entailed situations in
which I was greeted as an honored guest.
For example, when I was working on Women Who Light the Dark a
little bit later, I was in Nepal [in 2008] when they were in the process of
changing governments from a king to an elected government, which turned
out to be quite a violent time. People were driving through the streets and
shooting people through their office windows as they drove by.
[00:10:04] I was actually worried about whether or not I should
continue with my plan to go [to Nepal]. I kept e-mailing [Nepal] from
wherever I was before that--I think I was in Vietnam and then in Cambodia-and asking--“Should I come? Should I come?”
I was e-mailing the State Department. And emailing my husband,
“What does the newspaper say?”
The women in Nepal kept saying, “Of course, come. We’ll take care
of you.” And they did. It was great. I was never alone. I never felt afraid.
81

even with the head of the NGO that I was featuring [Lucky Chhetri,
founder of Empowering Women of Nepal]. We were having lunch one day
in her house, and all of a sudden UN soldiers walked past the window and
climbed to the roof of her house [laughs] because she lived at the top of a
hill and that was a good venue to see people below, enemies.
[00:11:01] I thought, “Why am I not just terrified?” I knew I was safe.
She walked out and said, “This is my house. You have no right to be here.”
[laughs]
Du: How do you think you were able to be so effective when bridging the
cultural gaps, and all the [other] differences you had with these women, in
order to reach them and have them invite you in as one of them?
Gianturco: That’s a good question. I always take my other books with me--I know exactly
how much every one of them weighs in case I have to unload and hand-carry
the books. I show my books to all of the women I interview so they know
what they’re getting into.
[00:11:49] I also describe the idea of the book I am working on so that
they can agree to be part of it. Usually the nonprofit or the organization that
they belong to has agreed theoretically to let their members participate, but I
always am very careful to be sure that each woman understands.
Then, we talk for usually an hour. I never pick up my camera first,
mostly because I am listening for things that might help tell a woman’s story
or for places where she goes frequently. Maybe she says she’s going to the
market, and I say, “May I come with you?”
I always start by asking women how they would like to be
82

photographed. Before smartphones, it was a big deal in some cultures to be
photographed at all, and in those cultures people always stood stiff with their
arms at their sides and looked very formal. I would then send them back that
photograph.
[00:13:07] It confused them that I continued to shoot after that. I
would continue to shoot for hours, and after a while they would just forget I
was there. [My continuing to take pictures] seemed ridiculous to them, but
anyway, that’s what I obviously wanted to do. Of course, later on they would
become so oblivious [to me] that the photos would become much more
natural.
But it was just a matter of making it clear that I was there to listen to
them and to focus on them. Many women were much less reticent [to talk]
than I expected. Many women around the world are not listened to, ever.
[00:13:50] The fact that I had come from so far away just to listen to
them, just to take them pictures of them leading their lives, made me less
threatening. I was something of a phenomenon, but I was clearly on their side.
Du: What sort of questions did you ask them when you were having your
conversations?
Gianturco: Well, once I [abandoned my] 116-question routine, I would usually start by
saying, “Tell me about your life. Where did you grow up, and what was your
family like? What was your favorite food?” [laughs] I would just get the
conversation started, and once they began talking, they would tell me all
kinds of things that I would never ask, never.
A Muslim woman in Turkey once went on at some length about the
83

fact that she was very careful to time her children nine years apart so that
she could afford to feed and educate them.
[00:14:56] She told me all about the birth control she was using and
where she got it, and said, “The government helps us with this.” I would
never ask [such personal] questions. But she wanted me to know that.
Du: That’s amazing. And in your experiences going to all these different festivals
for celebrating women, were there any festivals that didn’t turn out the way
you expected them to?
Gianturco: No, I really knew pretty much what to expect. There were individual events
that happened in the festivals I wasn’t prepared for. I wasn’t prepared for
the [part of the] Khasi festival where they cut off the head of the sheep, for
example. I actually can tell you now that I can take pictures with my eyes
closed. [laughs] I just couldn’t watch that. I thought, “Oh my God, why am
I here?” There were things that happened that surprised me.
Du: [00:15:58] Wow. And as you came to the close of Celebrating Women, did you
already have plans in mind for your third book or how did that come about?
Gianturco: I had plans in mind for my fourth book. My third book sort of sneaked up
on me. Book three was called ¡Viva Colores!: A Salute to the Indomitable People of
Guatemala.
For each of the two books before, both Celebrating Women and In Her
Hands, I had gone to Guatemala. I can get there fairly quickly--it’s five hours
from San Francisco--and do a test shoot to be sure that I [could execute my
idea. At that point], I wasn’t altogether comfortable yet with my
photography.
84

I was specifically worried about Celebrating Women because many
festivals happen at night, and there is lots of action--dancing and lots going
on. As you know, it’s very hard to photograph action in the dark. [laughs]
Your camera can’t handle both of those things, [action and low light, at the
same time].
[00:17:10] So I was doing test shoots in Guatemala. I actually spent a
summer doing pro bono photographs for the Ixchel Museum in Guatemala
City, which wanted to document weaving villages that had never been
photographed. So over the course of the ten-year period between 1995 and
2004 I had thousands of pictures of Guatemala. [They were not] taken as a
project, but as explorations.
[00:17:48] I was talking with the publisher about those pictures, and
he said that he would like to do a book about Guatemala. But I was already
working on the next project. I had begun researching Women Who Light the
Dark. I had no time even to think about a book about Guatemala or even
what would adhere all of those diffuse photographic elements.
I asked [my husband] David if he would look at my zillions of
Guatemala pictures and see if he could see any themes. He said, “I think the
theme is color. Let’s think about how to make this book a celebration of
these peoples’ spirits.”
He and I then went together to Guatemala to interview the forty
people who are featured in that book. He wrote the text, and all of the
pictures are mine. That was a collaboration.
Du: What was it like working with David?
85

Gianturco: [00:18:55] It was really hard. [laughs] For one thing, I have a huge respect
for David, but David’s approaches are always different from mine. That
makes life interesting when you’re married.
Our approaches are so different that they bring us into conflict. As I
told you, David had the idea that ¡Viva Colores!, should be a bilingual book,
and I was just horrified when I first heard that because it seemed to me to
be impossible. We were too far down the road to consider that.
But in fact ¡Viva Colores!, [became a bilingual book], which much
improved the quality of that project.
But [creating together was not always] easy.
Du: Did you learn new things about your photography and the places you were
visiting as a result of being with David and working on this project with
him?
Gianturco: [00:19:55] It is great to travel with somebody who is as--David was creative
director of an advertising agency, and he observes really, really well. And so
I would be shooting over here to the left, and David would see something
way over here to the right that I had my back to. I might--or might not-have been able to refocus and capture his picture. But he has a very accurate
and astute visual capacity that I really respect. I am glad to have that
working with me.
Du: That’s wonderful. So at this period of time you’re working on ¡Viva Colores!,
and you’re also beginning to think of your fourth one, Women Who Light the
Dark. Was it very busy for you to manage all of these different books at
once?
86

Gianturco: [00:21:01] It’s very hard to do two books at the same time for me because
writing is an internal process, and promoting is an external process. I almost
can’t do them at the same time. I was traveling to speak about and promote
¡Viva Colores! at the same time I was beginning to generate content for
Women Who Light the Dark.
It was very difficult. I was working twelve to fourteen days a day just
simply to do it. These are not kind of throwaway projects that you do in
addition to something else. They really are consuming and very demanding.
So that was difficult.
[00:21:51] I see Women Who Light the Dark as the first as a triptych. I
think about Women Who Light the Dark, Grandmother Power, and Wonder Girls
as different ways to tell the stories of girls’ and women’s activism at
different ages in their lives. And, yes, I had begun to conceive Women Who
Light the Dark at the same time I was trying to promote ¡Viva Colores!.
Let me show you Women Who Light the Dark. [sounds of a book being
picked up]. You can see where I was on the map on the inside front cover. I
was in all of those countries. There were fifteen of them this time.
Most of the stories in this book are about women who are heading
NGOs and doing very interesting, important work--working on the most
intractable problems that face women virtually everywhere.
[00:23:00] The first story was actually about a group started by a high
school English teacher [Betty Makoni] in Zimbabwe who started an
organization called the Girls Empowerment Network.
Betty had been listening to the stories that her high school students-87

her English students--were telling her and she discovered that the medicine
women in their culture were telling HIV-positive men that they would be
cured if they had sex with virgins. The men were having sex with--they were
raping--these teenage girls, who were, of course, then HIV-positive.
Betty Makoni decided that she would organize these girls and help
them understand what was going on, how to avoid it, how they could help
each other, how they could come to each other’s aid, and so forth.
[00:24:02] The first photograph is these girls at their board meeting. I
went to the board meeting expecting to see teachers and social workers. No.
Girls! [laughs] This [NGO actually inspired my idea of doing a book about
groups of activist] girls.
Du: Was it ever difficult for you to deal with these emotionally tough issues?
Gianturco: This was the turn in my own work when I made a decision not to avoid
these issues. Some of them were so disturbing that I had consciously chosen
to exclude them because I wasn’t sure I could handle them.
I took a photographic course in the Czech Republic and promised
myself--I was there for a month, taking one week-courses with very
experienced professional photographers. [00:24:58] I promised myself that
in the course of that month I would photograph everything I was afraid of
photographing. It was a real stretch. I photographed people kissing, and I
photographed people in church. [laughs]
I just barged into all kinds of places where it was awkward to
photograph--where I felt there were people doing things too private to be
photographed--trying to get over my own inhibitions. [My ability to
88

document the girls in Zimbabwe] was the result of [my experience in the
Czech Republic]. I knew I could photograph these girls who were working
on this really horrific problem.
Du: Is the way you approach these photographs of girls in tougher situations
different from, for example, craftswomen?
Gianturco: [00:25:54] The photographs are different, as you can see. That picture
wouldn’t be in In Her Hands. But is the approach different? [My
photography] has all been about learning. I continue to learn and continue
to have different ideas about how to do it, and I do a lot of experimenting.
The great challenge is to be able to edit down to the number of
photographs that fit in a chapter. This is a chapter about women working on
issues that have to do with domestic violence in Vietnam.
The great freedom is that although there aren’t very many pictures in
each chapter, you can take hundreds now with digital cameras, and [the
Vietnam chapter of Women Who Light the Dark] is about when I began using
a digital camera. For a long time after everybody else in this world was using
a digital camera, my publisher was still insisting on film. In fact, I think this
chapter [about Cuba] was taken on film and the rest were digital.
Du: [00:27:04] How did that change your technique and your style or even just
your process?
Gianturco: Exactly [the way I just] said. You take millions more pictures if you’re not
paying for film. So digital really opened up the possibilities for
experimenting.
Du: How long did working on this book take?
89

Gianturco: All the books, from beginning to end, take about five years. That’s a year
worth of research, a year to eighteen months of photography, a year to
write, and the balance to promote.
Du: Tell me about the promotion process for any book. What is that like, and
what does that include and entail?
Gianturco: [00:28:02] It’s a big surprise for people to discover that creating the book is
about a third of the work. Easily half, maybe two-thirds, is the marketing.
Many people, particularly those who do photography books, don’t
have thirty-four years’ worth of experience in marketing, which I had, thank
goodness. It was as if, finally, I had hit something--some part of these
projects--that I actually understood.
So what is involved? I always do a proprietary website for my books.
That’s like writing another whole book--I have somebody doing the
technical work. I could never manage that. That would probably be the
easiest part for you. It’s the harder part for me.
[00:29:04] I always have a schedule of events, and those all need to be
set up by me. For example, when I introduced Grandmother Power, I did fiftyfive slide lectures all over the US and Canada, which takes a huge
commitment of time. Fortunately, [a book tour is] doable on frequent flier
miles.
But somebody has to get those events arranged and handle all the
logistics--what kind of projector do you have and do you have a light on
your podium--and that somebody is me.
[00:29:54] I also frequently have traveling photography exhibits. You
90

just saw the beginning of the Wonder Girls exhibit in my dining room. Those
exhibits and all of the arrangements to travel them are done by me.
Also, I do lots of press. Usually I work with a freelance PR person
who does media placement. Although I did PR for Joseph Magnin long
away and far away, it’s now a very different business.
[My books have had some] wonderful press breaks. I told you already
about Oprah. But Wonder Girls has received publicity from Ms. Magazine and
ABC News. C-SPAN photographed [my granddaughter-coauthor Alex and
me] doing a bookstore event in Pasadena, and NPR has done interviews
about Wonder Girls and on and on and on.
[00:31:03] The combination of the photo exhibit and online presence
and almost daily postings on Facebook--all of these things are part of
[promoting] the book.
Separately and additionally, I stay in touch with all of the groups in
the book because I consider them collaborators. I really think that my name
on the cover is sort of happenstantial. These women have given me their
stories. I always send the chapter drafts back to them to fact-check.
[Creating the book is] an iterative and collaborative process.
[00:31:52] They are the first ones who get advance copies of the
book, and I keep them up to date on all of the [events where] I’m telling
stories about them, hoping to generate support and awareness of their work.
Actually, we should talk about the fact that all of these books are
philanthropic projects. We haven’t talked about that.
Du: Yes, tell me about that.
91

Gianturco: A hundred percent of my author royalties from Women Who Light the Dark
go to the Global Fund for Women. A hundred percent of my royalties from
each of these books goes to a nonprofit organization that’s working on the
issues in the book. I’ll tell you about Grandmother Power when we get there.
Global Fund for Women is also getting one hundred percent of the
author royalties from Wonder Girls. Even though the books are very
ambitious projects geographically, because I’m using frequent flier miles, the
expenses are limited enough that I can afford to give away the money I
would earn.
[00:33:10] I am committed to doing that. It’s one of the reasons that I
work so hard on promoting the books, because the more you promote, the
more you sell.
Du: How do you choose which organizations receive all of your royalties?
Gianturco: I work really hard to identify a recipient or beneficiary that is working
internationally. Global Fund for Women has worked in 177 countries. So
that means that the royalties can benefit women and girls practically all over
the world.
Grandmother Power--should we move on to Grandmother Power?
Du: Sure. Tell me about Grandmother Power.
Gianturco: [00:33:55] Grandmother Power documents the work of activist grandmothers
all over the world in fifteen countries. [Activist grandmothers are] another
topic that has never been explored, which, of course, makes it perfect for
me.
Grandmothers came to my attention when I was working in Africa
92

talking with women members of a women’s water collective in Kenya. Quite
happenstantially, I just was talking with the whole group. I never talk to a
whole group at the same time, but these women wanted to talk as a group.
So I said to them, “Tell me how many children you have.”
[00:35:03] And they went around the circle and one said, “I have four
and eight adopted.”
The next one said, “I have three and twelve adopted.”
I suddenly realized as we went on and everybody was speaking in the
same formulaic way, that what they meant was that they had three children
of their own and that they had adopted some usually very large number of
other children, many of whom were their own grandchildren because their
own children had died of AIDS.
Adoption was a pattern that I observed [as I continued to travel]. At
that time I was working in the J-shaped region of the African continent that
runs down the east side and loops up around South Africa. Those are the
countries that have been most damaged by AIDS.
[00:35:59] It is a pattern in those cultures that the grandmothers take
care of their grandchildren. As their children die, the grandchildren run to
the grandmothers after the funerals. In their old ages, when [the
grandmothers are] too old to work and too old to raise food to feed a
family, suddenly they have sometimes twelve to fifteen grandchildren living
with them.
The kids are grieving [because their parents have died]. The
grandmothers are grieving because their children have died. That whole
93

sexually-active middle generation is gone.
I left Africa after that trip and thought, “The future of this continent
rests in the hands of the grandmothers. What are grandmothers doing other
places?” said I to me.
What I discovered was that all over the world, there was an invisible,
international grandmother movement. They weren’t connected with each
other. They had all taken a look at this troubled world of ours and had said,
[exhales] “Not good enough for my grandchildren,” and had gotten to
work.
[00:37:09] The grandmothers in Africa were being supported by
grandmothers in Canada--8,000 grandmothers in Canada--who are part of
an organization--[Grandmothers to Grandmothers Campaign]--started by
the Stephen Lewis Foundation.
Stephen Lewis was Canada’s ambassador to the UN, and Kofi Annan
appointed him as special envoy to Africa for AIDS, Malaria, and TB. After
he had finished his stint, he came back to Canada and said, “I’m going to
spend the rest of my life trying to stem the tide of AIDS in Africa.”
[00:37:54] But Stephen Lewis didn’t have all the money he needed to
do that. And he was [worried about the grandmothers raising AIDS
orphans] in fifteen African countries where he had just been working. He
and his daughter--who had been working for the UN in New York--started
a foundation that could coordinate the grandmothers of Canada to help the
grandmothers of Africa.
The grandmothers of Canada loved this idea, and so they began
94

forming groups. The Canadian grandmothers will do anything to raise
money for the grandmothers in Africa.
Their work is not charitable. The grandmothers in Africa are now
organized in groups that apply for grants. And it might be that they need
just a little money, maybe enough just to buy seeds for a community garden.
The grandmothers in Canada are raising money all over the place.
They will sell ice cream at the beach. They’ll cater a wedding. They’ll make a
quilt and sell it. It’s amazing to visit them.
[00:39:02] The author royalties from Grandmother Power--this book--go
to the Stephen Lewis Foundation in Toronto to help grandmothers [raising
children orphaned by AIDs] in fifteen African countries. I am honored to
be able to do that.
Du: That’s incredible. Was this the book that you coauthored with your
granddaughter?
Gianturco: No, that is yet to come.
Du: So which countries did you visit for this grandmother book? Was it
countries in Africa?
Gianturco: Fifteen countries. No, [not just in Africa]. Grandmothers are doing many
things [in many places].
First of all, I should say that there are more grandmothers on the
planet today than there have ever been because for a long time nobody lived
to be older than thirty. So as longevity increased and as medical care
[improved, women] began living long enough to be grandmothers.
[00:40:08] It is really a very interesting population, very unlike the
95

crotchety old lady in her rocker with her crocheting. Grandmothers tend to
be better educated than they have ever been. Many of them lived through
the women’s movement, so they are very good at being activists. They’ve
changed the world before. They know how to do it.
Many of them have work experience. They are also [part of the huge]
demographic swing toward older people, particularly in this country but
internationally as well. So grandmothers tend to be a vital, educated,
extremely activist-oriented group, and they’re working on all kinds of issues.
[00:40:55] For example, they are working on cultural preservation and
the environment and human rights and education and justice and health and
politics and energy and so forth. This book tells that story.
My author photograph this time is a picture of me with both grandgirls. That was prescient because, as you know, one of those grand-girls,
when she was older, got to be my coauthor on Wonder Girls.
Du: That’s wonderful. This is your fifth book by now, and by this time you’ve
accumulated a massive knowledge about women around the globe. How
does this understanding shape or affect your understanding of women’s
issues domestically in the United States?
Gianturco: [00:41:57] None of the books so far had [focused on] the United States, as
you noticed. That’s a good observation. Wonder Girls does have three groups
in the US. The fact is that since working in the first women-owned
advertising agency, I really had not been very involved with women’s issues
in the US. Although I was sympathetic, that had not been where my
attention had been. And lots had been happening since I was paying
96

attention, which is one reason that Wonder Girls includes chapters about girls
in the US.
Du: [00:42:52] Again with all of these books, you’re venturing onto projects that
have not been covered before. In these endeavors, are you looking to
anyone for support?
Gianturco: There are people who [specialize in] issues related to aging and women.
There is still the Stanford the Center on Longevity run by Laura Carstensen,
also a friend of Estelle Freedman, by the way. Laura used to be head of the
Michelle Clayman Institute and then started this [Center on Longevity]. I
interviewed her.
[00:43:50] There is [an anthropologist, Kristen Hawkes], who
developed something called the grandmother hypothesis at the University of
Utah. She had the idea--based on work she had done with [the Hadza] tribe
in Africa--that [explains why] human grandmothers exist--in other words,
live longer than simply the time during which they menstruate. From an
evolutionary standpoint it’s an unlikely reality that grandmothers live so long
afterwards.
[00:45:14] Hawkes’ idea was that the reason they do is so that they
can help raise their grandchildren. I talked with her.
What else did I do to prepare for this book? I interviewed the
Canadian grandmothers. That was the moral equivalent of doing test
photography in Guatemala. I talked with the Stephen Lewis Foundation
people, knocked on their door, and said, “I think I might want to do a book
about the Canadian grandmothers and the African grandmothers.”
97

[00:46:01] They said, “Who are you?” [laughs] So that’s how this
book started.
Du: Tell me about the projects you’re working on now.
Gianturco: I’ll tell you about Wonder Girls. Well, what can I tell you about Wonder Girls? As
far as I can tell, there are no other books that document the work of groups
of activist girls. There are books about individual activists like Malala.
But I was seeing, as early as 2007, girls in Zimbabwe who began a girls
movement in their country. They made child rape a national issue using an
interesting tool.
[00:47:08] Remember, [the Girls’ Empowerment Network] was started
by a high school English teacher. Those girls use poetry, which they write
about their own experiences and recite in public. As soon as they do, [snaps
fingers] their communities are mobilized to action against the men who rape
girls.
I’ve been interested for a long time in what groups of girls can do, even
groups of very young girls. I was particularly interested in the age group from
ten to eighteen. The UN says you’re no longer a girl after eighteen. You’re a
woman.
So Wonder Girls. I was thinking about this book for a while, both in
relationship to Women Who Light the Dark and Grandmother Power. It was a
natural next step to explore the topic of groups of activist girls, partly because
I think these intractable problems will take a long time to solve.
[00:48:16] I was interested in groups because once there is [an
organizational] structure, the current participants can go on to the rest of their
98

lives--and younger girls can grow into that structure and continue the work.
So I wanted to focus on groups from the beginning.
[For Wonder Girls], I went to thirteen countries, one of which was the
US, and interviewed fifteen groups of activist girls working on all kinds of
initiatives from the environment to social justice to exploitation to child
marriage and so forth.
[00:49:05] I was very aware going into this book that I was seventyeight, and these girls were all ten to eighteen. Michelle Sangster, who is Alex
Sangster’s mother, my daughter-in-law, said to me, “What would you think if
Alex did this book with you?”
I had said, “I had thought about that,” which I had, because it was
really clear to me that the book would be better if [I collaborated with]
somebody nearer the age of the girls.
I didn’t want to ask Alex alone since she has a younger sister, and the
three of us had been absolutely tied at the hip since they were tiny. And I
thought, “I can’t ask Alex to do this, without Avery” and Avery was too
young.
[00:50:02] I’ll just digress a minute and tell you a story. My
granddaughters call me “Grandmother.” They call their other grandmother
“Grandma.” One time when I was visiting, they kept calling me “Grandma,”
and then they were just mortified.
I said, “It’s okay, because we’re all grands. I am, and so are you.” They
were just at the age that that sounded like a club.
So Avery--who [was seven and] had no teeth in the front of her mouth.
99

Her top and bottom front teeth were gone, so she couldn’t say an “S” if she
had to. She said, “Grandmother, we need a ‘logan.”
I said, “Okay, what’s our slogan, Avery?”
She said, “We are grand. We’ll always be grand. Go grands.”
[00:50:53] Alex just began practically rapping. She said, “This is our
pledge. We are grand. We’ll always be grand. Together we’ll stand. We’ll lend a
helping hand.” She was going on and on. I never can remember our pledge.
I got meteorites that had fallen on China, which I thought was grand
enough. So we started all of our meetings with, “We are grand. We’ll always
be grand,” da, da, da. We would do the rap pledge, and then we would click
our Chinese meteorites, and have meetings. Sometimes we would do
beadwork, and sometimes we would make paper-doll clothes, and sometimes
we would do tea parties.
For years, we had done meetings. To work alone with Alex without
having asked Avery would have been awful. I said I would discuss this [idea-of working with Alex] with Avery.
[00:51:55] Avery, who was [as I said] at that point seven, said, “It’s
okay, Grandmother. You should work with Alex. I’m not a very good
storyteller.”
Having watched this book come together ever since, Avery told me
recently, “Grandmother, I just want you to know I was born to write.”
[laughs] I think I’m on notice. I think the next book is going to be with Avery.
So Wonder Girls--a hundred percent of the royalties from this book go
to the Global Fund for Women. They have a special fund for [grassroots
100

groups of] girls around the world. I interviewed 102 girls in person, traveling
on my frequent flier miles for a week to each place.
[00:52:49] Alex worked with me in four places. Even though she was in
school, she interviewed seventy girls from thirteen countries [via Skype and
Facetime]. She took photographs with me when we were working together; a
couple of these chapters are photographed almost exclusively by Alex.
Remember the story about my father gave me a camera when I was
eight? I gave Alex her first point-and-shoot camera--there were not yet cell
phones with cameras--when she was two.
She was so little. She photographed people’s feet and the dog’s tail and
all these things down here where you and I don’t even look for pictures. It
was a great way to see what her world looked like.
Well, she’s long since graduated to a DSLR [digital single-lens reflex
camera] and she is wonderfully free in her composition, her ideas about what
to shoot, and very creative. So it’s fun to shoot with her.
[00:54:05] But in addition to photographing and interviewing, she also
wrote the last section of every chapter.
Du: That’s very impressive for an eleven-year-old.
Gianturco: Exactly. I came away from this project full of respect for Alex and young girls.
This is her section, titled “How YOU Can Change Our World.” She set forth
the challenge and the change and how you can help--all things she got from
her own interviews. Down here she thanks the girls [whom she interviewed]
by name.
This section is so much her own doing that when I said--we were
101

talking about this project--“Alex, do you have an idea about what you want
your page to look like?”
She said, “Oh, yes,” and jumped on her computer and drew this layout.
[00:54:59] I said, “And what color should the background be?”
She said, “It should be blue. I’ll look it up and give you the exact
color.” So that is her blue. Those are her stars--Wonder Woman’s outfit has
stars, so Alex wanted Wonder Girls to have stars.
I just sent Alex’s design to the designer when we got to that point, and
her page looks exactly the way she wanted.
Du: That’s amazing. Tell me more about what onboarding your granddaughter
Alex was like onto this project.
Gianturco: I couldn’t imagine how to tell somebody what I do and how to do it, [so I
sought help].
Sidebar story: I am on the advisory board of a group of children at
Saint Hilary School in Tiburon, an afterschool program called Pencils for
Africa. [Here is the reason for the program’s name]:
[00:55:57] A friend of mine, [Jackson Kaguri], from Uganda, grew up
in such a poor family that his father couldn’t afford a pencil for each of his
five children so they could go to school. So the father broke a pencil into
five pieces and gave each child a stub. Jackson is now a CNN Hero [and
has] started a school for 43,000 AIDS orphans [in Nyaka, Uganda. When
Jackson told his pencil story at Saint Hilary School], the children said, “We
could recycle our pencils. We can send them to Africa.” So the name of
their group is Pencils for Africa.
102

I said [to the teachers who run that program], “I want to teach Alex
how to do a good interview.” They had worked on that skill with their
students because the Pencils for Africa children interview--by Skype--the
children in Africa.
I had [observed that] young kids are asked a question in school, and
they give an answer. [Q&A] is not conducive to a fluid and expansive
interview. What you’re doing right now--provoking a rounded, full, rich
conversation--is just beyond their experience. I thought, “How am I going
to teach Alex that?”
[She and I] ended up having a phone meeting about it, since she
doesn’t live around here. She called me, and I picked up my cell phone. I
[searched for my] written notes, and I had a lot of stuff on my desk.
[00:58:06] I put the phone [between shoulder and ear as] I was fishing
around trying to find my notes. All of a sudden, I heard this little voice say,
“Excuse me, please, Grandmother. I think I am looking into your ear.”
I had never done a FaceTime call. I said, “Oh, Alex. How are you?”
There were so many things that I learned from working with Alex. You
can’t imagine. It was just an endless education for me.
People always say to me, “Oh, she’s so lucky to have worked with
you. You must have taught her a lot.”
The fact is, the amount I learned from Alex was unlimited. It
continues today. The experience was just great. As I said to you earlier,
everybody should spend time with an eleven-year-old, everybody.
[00:59:01] I would get us lost in Los Angeles, and she would [hop on
103

Google Maps and] say, “I’ve got it, Grandmother. Turn left.” We would be
in Guadalajara, and she would be the only one who knew what the menu
said--I don’t speak Spanish--because she was using Google Translate.
It was great. She just plain knows a lot of things that I don’t know;
many things [in addition to] technology. But anyway, working with Alex was
a great joy and it made the book better.
Du: That’s amazing. When was Wonder Girls published?
Gianturco: October 2017.
Du: What are some current projects that you’re busy with now? Are you
promoting Wonder Girls?
Gianturco: [00:59:49] Yes. I have been doing all of the things I just described to you
about promoting a book. Some fun things that we have done? There was a
photographic exhibit at the World Affairs Council in San Francisco for four
months.
Because they always do a reception for artists who have their
photographs exhibited in their gallery, I said, “Let’s [delay the reception] for
the launch of the book on October 11, which is the UN International Day
of the Girl Child.”
They said, “What would you like to have to eat at the reception?”
And I said, “Oh, champagne and cake,” which is not what they
usually serve at the World Affairs Council. But they had champagne and an
amazing cake about the size of this desk with [an image of] “Wonder
Woman” in frosting on the top. It was great. So we had a wonderful book
launch with thirty photographs [from the book on display].
104

[01:01:06] The husband of the woman who runs the girls’ group in
Guadalajara had flown in for the launch, and there were several other
important people with us. I did a slide lecture about the stories from the
book.
Alex moderated a panel of the chief operating officer of the Global
Fund for Women and the executive director of One World Children’s Fund
and the executive director and founder of Rise Up, all of whom have
grantees in the book.
There Alex was, sitting at the World Affairs Council in her great little
black dress, running this panel discussion about girls’ issues around the
world with these women who fund girls’ [groups globally]. It was great.
Then we signed books. It was such fun.
[01:02:10] Alex has been interviewed with me. Her first interview was
with Lauren Schiller, who has an NPR show about women called Inflection
Point. Both of us were in Los Angeles, and Lauren was here in Northern
California.
We were in a sound booth in LA. Alex had never been in a sound
booth. It’s a very strange environment. I don’t know if you have [ever been
in a sound booth]. Black rubbery knobs on the walls.
Alex had worked so hard--she had asked for the questions ahead of
time and worked so hard on her answers. But of course she was asked other
questions that she wasn’t expecting, and she was so good. I was very proud
of her.
[01:03:02] I think many people in this country, and maybe other
105

places, tend to infantilize young girls and assume that they don’t have their
own thoughts. It’s really just great to see that, in fact, they have wellfounded opinions [and ideas]. It really was fun to interview girls for the
book, and it was fun to see that [same characteristic] in Alex.
Du: That’s incredible. Throughout all of these books, we’ve talked about so
many different women’s issues that you’ve been a part of and have helped
document. Is there anything else about any of these projects that you’d like
to mention?
Gianturco: [01:03:45] Hm. I have been really surprised by how many readers of the
books followed the pattern of philanthropy that the books model. For
example, thinking all the way back to the beginning, to In Her Hands, I know
now--happenstantially--of about $120,000 that went from the readers of that
book to the groups in the book.
Du: That’s incredible.
Gianturco: There’s no way to track [donations]. We’re not set up to track anything. But
when I went back to Gujarat, my interpreter said, “Do you want to see the
houses that the women are building with the money from your book?”
There had been a huge earthquake in Gujarat that had decimated the
houses of the mirror embroiderers whom I talked about earlier. The women
were indeed [working with] rebar and mud bricks, which they made, and
they were rebuilding the village.
[01:05:09] I said, “Where did this money come from?”
They said, “Well, we thought you would know. A woman wired it to
us the morning that she heard (that there had been an earthquake) on the
106

television news. She recognized the group from having just read your book,
and she wired us $10,000.”
Aid to Artisans called me one day and said, “Have you ever heard of
this woman,” who lived somewhere I’ve never heard of either. I certainly
did not know her. She had a family foundation that had given $50,000 to
Aid to Artisans for the artists in the book. What?
[01:05:52] Little by little, I began discovering that the fact that we
always included the groups’ contact information, both in the book and on
the book website, made it easy for people to make contact with them, and
that in fact, unbeknownst to me, readers were supporting these groups. I
had no idea. It was wonderful, really.
Du: It’s amazing to hear about these wonderful networks and communities that
you’ve built up because of your work.
Gianturco: Who knew?
Du: Just to tie everything together now that we’ve talked about your incredible
career both in photography and in business, are there any other thoughts
you have, any other things you want to share about any of your times in
these fields?
Gianturco: Hm. I think I want to talk a little bit more about my family.
Du: [01:07:05] Yes, I would love to hear that.
Gianturco: I mentioned at lunch that both of my grand-girls are Chinese-American. My
son married a Chinese-American woman. Both of her parents had come
from China. David’s son married a woman from Mexico. So his
grandchildren are Mexican-American. Really, [our family is] like a little UN.

This is so different from what life was like in general when I was
growing up that I find it very heartening. I think as we all become more
connected with each other, positive changes are virtually inevitable.
[01:08:10] My son, Scott, is as committed as I am to what’s
happening with people around the world. He and I go to a poverty
conference--an international poverty conference held in Mexico--every year.
Alex and Avery said, “Well, why can’t children come?” They said,
“We have an idea. Let us design a children’s program for this conference,
and then we’ll all talk to the people who run the conference and see if they
want us to run it.”
They got yellow stickies, and wrote down all their ideas and glued
them on the windows of their house, then took them down and rearranged
them [until they] got the whole program worked out in their minds.
[01:09:03] Their idea was that the program should be called Just Kids,
and that it should be [attended by the] daughters and sons of the delegates
who attended the poverty conference. Each child and delegate parent would
have an hour to teach the other children what it was like to grow up in their
culture.
The people who run the conference said, “Well, yes, sure. We can
give it a try.” And this is now the fifth year of that program. [Alex and
Avery] run it. They introduce the speakers, and they conduct the Q&A
afterwards.
The kids do all kinds of things together. They do storytelling, and
they do cooking, and they do dancing, and they do art. It is really amazing to
108

see what happens when you put thirty or thirty-five kids from all over the
world together in the same place. I don’t know of anything else like it.
[01:10:07] But Alex and Avery are convinced that if they all become
friends and begin to understand each other and see each other year after
year--maybe someday the [participants can work together to cause positive
change].
There may be many different ways that [my work has influenced
people]. I really don’t know any more details than I knew [about the
donations] being kindled by In Her Hands’ readers.
[01:10:54] I don’t know what will be the ultimate effect of my work
but I’m beginning to see the outlines of a legacy. I am shy to say this, but I
am really proud to see what’s beginning to happen.
Du: You should certainly be proud of all this work. That’s amazing.
