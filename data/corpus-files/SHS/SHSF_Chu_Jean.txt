Introduction
This oral history was conducted by the Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program in
collaboration with the Stanford University Archives. The program is under the direction of the
Oral History Committee of the Stanford Historical Society.
The Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program furthers the Society’s mission “to foster
and support the documentation, study, publication, dissemination, and preservation of the
history of the Leland Stanford Junior University.” The program explores the institutional
history of the University, with an emphasis on the transformative post-WWII period, through
interviews with leading faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and others. The interview recordings and
transcripts provide valuable additions to the existing collection of written and photographic
materials in the Stanford University Archives.
Oral history is not a final, verified, or complete narrative of events. It is a unique, reflective,
spoken account, offered by the interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it may be
deeply personal. Each oral history is a reflection of the past as the interviewee remembers and
recounts it. But memory and meaning vary from person to person; others may recall events
differently. Used as primary source material, any one oral history will be compared with and
evaluated in light of other evidence, such as contemporary texts and other oral histories, in
arriving at an interpretation of the past. Although the interviewees have a past or current
connection with Stanford University, they are not speaking as representatives of the University.
Each transcript is edited by program staff and by the interviewee for grammar, syntax, and
occasional inaccuracies and to aid in overall clarity and readability--but is not fact-checked as
such. The approach is to maintain the substantive content of the interview as well as the
interviewee’s voice. As a result of this editing process, the transcript may not match the
recording verbatim. If a substantive deletion has been made, this is generally indicated at the
relevant place on the transcript. Substantive additions are noted in brackets or by footnote.
All uses of the interview transcripts and recordings are covered by a legal agreement between
the interviewee and the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University

reserved by Stanford University.

Abstract
In this oral history, Jean H. Chu (formerly Jean H. Fetter) discusses her twenty-five-year career
at Stanford University where she served as Dean of Undergraduate Admissions, as assistant to
two university presidents (Richard W. Lyman and Gerhard Casper), and in other administrative
capacities.
Chu begins with an account of her childhood in Wales during World War II, when German
bombings demolished nearby Swansea and frequently sent her scrambling for shelter. Raised
by a great-aunt and great-uncle, she recalls how her youthful interest in mathematics and
physics was fostered at a rigorous all-women’s high school. Her excellence there helped gain
admission to Oxford University’s all-women’s college, St. Hugh’s. In vivid detail, Chu recounts
her experiences as one of six women, compared to 120 men, studying physics at Oxford. She
was awarded a first in physics, among the best in her class.
During her Oxford years, she met and married American Alexander (Sandy) Fetter (now
Professor Emeritus of Physics at Stanford), and she discusses accompanying him to successive
faculty appointments at Harvard, Berkeley, and finally Stanford. Describing life as a faculty
wife and mother of small children, she recalls a brief job with William Shockley that led to a
teaching position and then assistant professorship in physics at San Jose State.
Turning to her employment at Stanford, Chu discusses her work with David Halliburton of the
English Department on two grant-funded projects that she used to promote recruitment of
women in sciences. She credits the broad perspective of Stanford that she gained during that
project with helping her win appointment as assistant to Stanford President Richard W.
Lyman. She recalls a heavy workload filtering the barrage of mail and in-person complaints
brought to the president. Described as a “cog between big wheels,” she says, she learned about
how the university operated at the highest level.
Chu offers a brief account of her time as Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and Research
under Jerry Lieberman where she oversaw the recruitment of women and minorities into

9

graduate programs at Stanford and worked to develop grievance procedures for graduate
students.
Much of the oral history involves the many challenges she faced as Dean of Admissions. She
describes the conflict she confronted between those who supported recruiting “well-rounded”
students and others who favored “angular” students (“nerds” with extraordinary talents). Chu
tells how she enabled the Department of Mathematics and later the departments of Music, Art,
Drama, and Dance to review outstanding applicants in their fields, using the model created for
athletes. She explains other policies she initiated and provides a detailed description of the
review process, recounting some unusual cases as well as special efforts to recruit minorities
and women.
Chu outlines her service on the search committee that selected Gerhard Casper to be the new
university president and the circumstances that led her to accept the role as his assistant. She
contrasts her experiences as assistant to Lyman and Casper.
Concluding her remarks, Chu recalls her experiences with her second husband, Steven Chu,
when he received the Nobel Prize in physics.

Jean H. Chu
Biography
Jean Holmes Chu (formerly Fetter) served in multiple positions over twenty-five years at
Stanford University, including Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and assistant to two
presidents, Richard W. Lyman and Gerhard Casper. A graduate of Oxford University’s then
women’s college, St. Hugh’s, and a pioneering woman in physics and university administration,
she is a longtime advocate of recruiting and preparing women for university roles, especially in
the sciences.
Chu came to Stanford in 1975, as Associate Director of the Center for Teaching and Learning
supported by grants from the Danforth Foundation and the Lillie Program for Faculty
Renewal. With the support from the Danforth Foundation, she helped initiate a program in the
Bay Area to attract high school girls to the sciences, a program which subsequently expanded
to the national level. In 1977, she became the first woman to serve as assistant to the president
of Stanford. Working with Richard W. Lyman, she was exposed to the full range of campus
issues. As Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and Research from 1980 to 1984, under the
leadership of Professor Gerald J. Lieberman, Chu was responsible among other duties for
recruiting women and minorities into Stanford graduate programs.
Chu served as Dean of Undergraduate Admissions from 1984 to 1991. Her insistence on
academic excellence brought her into occasional conflict with the athletics program and alumni
boosters. Nevertheless, she extended the model used for admitting athletes--whereby coaches
provide input on outstanding candidates to the admissions department--to other departments,
allowing mathematics and the arts the same privilege. She also revised the review process and
expanded efforts to recruit minorities.
Following her time as Dean of Admissions, and while on sabbatical leave, she served as
executive vice-chairman of the search committee that appointed President Gerhard Casper and
subsequently accepted his invitation to serve as his assistant, her last position at Stanford.

11

Born in Great Britain, Chu spent World War II in Swansea, Wales with her family. She
attended an all-girls high school and was admitted to St. Hugh’s College at Oxford University
in 1956. There she earned a BA in physics with first-class honors and MA and DPhil degrees in
physics. Captain of the women’s varsity basketball team, she won the college Hurry Prize for
best all-around undergraduate.
Chu came to Stanford in 1965 as the wife of Alexander “Sandy” Fetter, now Professor
Emeritus of Physics. While tending to their two small children, she worked briefly with
Professor William Shockley, a job that led to a teaching position and then an assistant
professorship in physics at San Jose State.
She is now married to Steven Chu, Professor of Physics and Molecular and Cellular Physiology
at Stanford and a Nobel Prize winner in physics. She is author of Questions and Admissions:
Reflections on 100,000 Admissions Decisions at Stanford.

INTERVIEWEE:

JEAN H. CHU, INTERVIEW 1 (part 1 of 2)

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

AUGUST 26, 2016

Marine-Street:

This is Natalie Marine-Street with the Stanford Historical Society’s Oral
History Program. Today is August 26, 2016. I’m here with Jean Chu, an
emeritus staff member who has held several important management positions
at Stanford, including service as the dean of undergraduate admissions from
1984 to 1991. We’re conducting this interview as part of the Stanford Staff
Oral History Project, and we are doing so at Jean’s home in Menlo Park. Jean,
I’d like to begin by asking you to tell us just about where you were born and a
little bit about the place where you grew up.

Chu:

[00:01:04] I was born just before World War II in 1937 in Swansea, which is
in South Wales. I was brought up in an English speaking family, although
surrounded by Welsh speaking people, which was an interesting dynamic. I
lived in Wales until I was sixteen years old, so I had my most formative
educational years in Wales.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

What was Swansea like? What kind of a place was it?
[00:01:40] It was very interesting after World War II started because there
were major steel works nearby. The Germans bombed the center of Swansea.
It was a town of maybe fifty thousand people. They bombed the whole center
13

beyond recognition. It was absolutely astounding as a child. I was eight years
old when the war finished. I have vivid recollections of an air raid warning
sounding and having to run in the back garden and into a bomb shelter, or
under the stairs of the house. But then to go into the town center and see it
just completely demolished. It’s very different now, of course. It recovered
like London did after the blitz.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did they have blackouts and things?
[00:02:37] Oh, yes. Blackouts, very seriously taken, blackouts, especially since
the Germans--Wales is on the western part of England, but the Germans
infiltrated so far. One of the things I found amazing, my father was in the
Royal Air Force and had access after the war to German maps. The maps of
my hometown were so detailed they even had little back lanes in it. It was a
bit frightening to see how much they knew. I mean these were the days
before Google Maps

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

You lived outside of the city a little way?
[00:03:15] Yes. A little way outside the city.
When the air raid sirens would go off did you have a bomb shelter in your
backyard?

Chu:

[00:03:24] Yes. We did. Unfortunately it wasn’t very well designed. It always
filled with water. Wales is notorious for rain, and so when it rained the shelter
flooded. Our most common hideaway was under the stairs of the house. We
had a little bed there. I grew up mostly with my great aunt who was childless,
my great aunt and uncle. I stayed in their house during most of the bombing
raids. She was a very calming influence. I don’t know why I wasn’t more
14

frightened. You know, you could hear these planes overhead dropping
bombs.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Was your dad in the air force before the war began?
[00:04:14] No. I was so young I don’t remember the exact details. Most men
over the age of eighteen served in the armed forces.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

How about your mother? Did she work in the war industries at all?
[00:04:34] No, she didn’t. My mother didn’t work until after I went to high
school. I was the first in my family to go to college. Neither of my parents
were college educated though both were very intelligent. My father worked in
a solicitor’s office, and my mother worked in some clerical job after I went to
high school. I don’t remember the details.

Marine-Street:

They weren’t college educated. What kind of expectations did they have for
you in regards to education?

Chu:

[00:05:05] I think they were very proud of me. As my great aunt used to say,
“Jean always has her head in a book.” How you bring up your children to be
curious and self-motivated is, I think, an art and a science. I was very
fortunate that I loved to read. I loved school. I was always incredibly proud
of being a very good student. Where the motivation came from is hard to
know.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Do you remember the kinds of things you liked to read as a child?
[00:05:52] [laughter] They probably didn’t exist in this country. There was a
series called the Biggles books which was about an air force fighter. Then the
Worrals books about a woman who served in the armed forces. They were
World War II related. They made a big impression on me. Then I loved
15

mathematics. My great uncle was the manager of a department store and he
would bring home these big ledgers. He would write out in the ledgers a
whole series of sums for me to do and would give me a page to do. Then he
would mark them and put “excellent” or “good.” This was a great source of
delight.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did you ever go into work with him in the department store?
[00:06:42] I didn’t go to work with him. When I went to high school we both
took the same bus every morning, the Number 9 bus, which took him to his
work and me to my high school. The high school was really an incredible
experience. It was an all girls’ high school, all women teachers, and there I
had my first role models. They were all unmarried. I think there was one, my
Latin teacher, who was married and she was considered an aberration. They
had incredibly high standards. At the end of each term the head mistress
would stand in front of the whole school and read out the reports of each
grade form--form they were called. I was so competitive that I always wanted
to be first to be read out, meaning I was top of my form.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

They’d read you in order?
[00:07:46] In the order of your grades, yes. I’m sure today that would be
unheard of. Privacy.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

They even went all the way down to the last person?
[00:07:55] Yes.
Oh, my. [laughter]
[00:07:56] Yes. [laughter] Yes. Everybody knew what their standing was. It
was fine for me because I was always number one. I had a great competitor,
16

Jill. I still remember her name. Jill Dadds. She went to Cambridge and I went
to Oxford. Jill and I always used to alternate Number 1 and Number 2.
Marine-Street:

You mentioned that the teachers weren’t married. Did you recall, did they
have to quit or was it just common expectation?

Chu:

[00:08:26] The phrase “blue stocking” in England referred to academic
women whose life was devoted to their careers. I had the same experience
when I followed through to Oxford, too.

Marine-Street:

Tell me about what your science education was like then? Did you know that
you wanted to do science that early?

Chu:

[00:08:50] Yes. English--British. I say English because I did finish my last
three years of high school in London. The British system tended in the 1950s
to be --I’m dating myself--very, very specialized. At the age of fifteen you
took a series of what were called O Level Exams. That was Ordinary Level.
Then A Level, which was Advanced Level. And by the time you got to
Advanced Level you were essentially studying three or four subjects. In the
Sixth Form I studied pure mathematics, applied mathematics, physics and
chemistry. That was it.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Was that something that you got to choose, or did they direct you?
[00:09:40] You chose. Of course, the other wonderful thing about being in an
all girls’ school, if you were good at math or physics you weren’t considered
aberrant. Somebody had to be leader in that flock. It was quite a shock
getting to Oxford and being surrounded by men. In my graduating class at
Oxford there were five or six women and a hundred and twenty men. To go
from an all girls’ school to that environment was quite something.
17

Marine-Street:

Tell me a little bit about applying to Oxford. What was the admissions
process like?

Chu:

[00:10:31] You had to take these A Level exams. The first thing they looked
at were your A Level grades. Oxford and Cambridge, being elitist institutions,
had their own entrance exams. I don’t remember about London University. I
took entrance exams in, again, pure and applied mathematics and physics.
There was also a general exam which I took in my high school. The papers
were sent to my high school and supervised by the head mistress. Not very
many girls applied to Oxford and Cambridge because it was highly selective.
I’ll take this with me to my grave: In this general exam I can remember still
two questions. One was, “Can one have pleasure in one’s arm?”

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Hmmm.
[00:11:27] I remember being thrown by that. You had a choice fortunately.
That was not one I chose. Then one which was more appealing to me as a
scientist was, “What determined the color of a hen’s egg?” [laughter] I mean,
nothing you could have studied in class. Right? Unless you’d been a
philosopher. I’d never studied any philosophy. How can one have pleasure in
one’s arm? OK. Then these exam questions were sent off to Oxford. If you
met their standard, you were called for an interview. I was called both for an
interview and I had to do a physics practical exam. Then I remember with
incredible joy getting this letter saying I’d been admitted to this Oxford
College, St. Hugh’s.

Marine-Street:

St. Hugh’s was a coed college then?

18

Chu:

[00:12:25] No. I went up, as they say, to Oxford in 1956 when there were five
women’s colleges. Margaret Thatcher went to an all women’s college. The
current prime minister of the U.K., Theresa May, went to my Oxford
College.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Oh, is that right?
[00:12:50] In my day, there were five women’s colleges and twenty-six men’s
colleges. We had our tutor in our college, and then we went to joint university
lectures with my hundred and twenty male colleagues. Then we all took the
same exams. The exam system was formidable. We took what were called
honor moderations at the end of the first year. Then you didn’t have another
exam that counted until the end of your third year, your final year. It was
called Schools. You had to dress up in this academic outfit. Then the results
of your Schools papers were printed in the London Times.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Oh, my.
[00:13:33] Yes. It’s a variation on a theme of my high school principal reading
out the order of merit in the class.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

These were written exams, not oral?
[00:13:46] They were written exams and there were two practical exams in
physics. You got a first, a second, a third, or, God forbid, a fourth, or you
failed. If you were a borderline first or second degree, you got called for what
was called a viva, an oral exam. Fortunately, I was lucky enough—well, I say
lucky. I worked incredibly hard. I got a first, an unviva’d first. I was very
proud of myself.

Marine-Street:

An unviva’d first?
19

Chu:

[00:14:24] Yes. A viva was the oral exam if you were borderline first or
second. If you got an unviva’d you were a clear cut [first].

Marine-Street:
Chu:

You were clear. I see. How wonderful.
[00:14:35] It’s a brutal exam system. In fact, I’m going back for my college
reunion in a couple of weeks. I’d be curious to see if the exam system has
changed. It was so brutal. A number of people committed suicide. I mean
they just couldn’t take the pressure because--

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

While you were there?
[00:14:55] Yes.
Oh, my.
[00:14:56] Because it was that exam which determined the class of your
degree.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

You were the first in your family to go to college.
[00:15:09] Yes.
I always imagined Oxford as a place where generations had gone before and
that there would have been a lot of class [hierarchy] there.

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:15:21] That’s exactly right.
Did you encounter that?
[00:15:23] Yes. I did. In fact, when I subsequently came to live in the United
States in 1962 one of the great senses of relief I had was I had escaped the
British class system. First of all, you could tell by people’s accents, upper
class, lower class. You could immediately tell when you walked into a room
and you started a conversation whether someone came from a privileged
family or not.
20

I’ll never forget. This is an example of the class system: I spent one
summer vacation as a waitress and I wanted to go on an Oxford/Cambridge
ski trip. I’d never been skiing. I saved up enough money. And who should be
on the Oxford/Cambridge ski trip but Winston Churchill’s grandson.
[00:16:30] As we picked up our bags at the end of the Oxford/Cambridge ski
trip, Winston Churchill came along and said something like, “I wonder whose
bags those peasants belong to.”
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[laughter] Winston Churchill himself?
[00:16:54] Winston Churchill’s grandson who was my contemporary at
Oxford. Oxford has produced many British prime ministers. David Cameron,
Tony Blair [Anthony Charles Lynton “Tony” Blair]. I mentioned Theresa
May. Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May are two Oxford women prime
ministers. David Cameron and Tony Blair and [laughter] the notorious Boris
Johnson [Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson] who’s now foreign secretary,
all went to Eton, the probably snootiest upper class British public school, as
they are called, and then all went on to Oxford. The class system was
pervasive.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

I would imagine it would have affected socializing.
[00:17:48] Yes. It did affect socializing. The things that sustained me were
tutorials. Tutorials are when you have two students meeting once a week with
a tutor. My tutorial partner was from another college, Somerville College, and
she’d been a London debutante. [laughter] I sort of gloated to myself, but she
wasn’t very smart. In fact, as they say, she got sent down after the end of our
first year at Oxford because she wasn’t up to it academically. You know, even
21

though I was a working class Welsh woman from a Welsh high school, I was
smarter than she was. In the end smarts prevailed.
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

You found other people that you liked there socially?
[00:18:47] Yes. Yes. I did. I think, one has lifetime friends from college years.
How did the class differences manifest themselves in academics? Was there
any of that?

Chu:

[00:19:02] Eton is probably the extreme case. It was an all men’s school. Still
is, as far as I know, an all men’s school. They learned Greek and Latin from
the age of ten or twelve on. I mean I did learn some Greek in high school, in
my wonderful Welsh high school, and I did take three languages, but these
children were so privileged. I always argued with my American husband that
there was no class system in the U.S., and he said, yes, there is, but it’s more
subtle than in the U.K.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did you encounter any gender dynamics in studying with so many men?
[00:20:03] Just in the sheer numbers in physics. A hundred and twenty men
and six women. It was a little intimidating in class. I was of a generation
where most of the men, in fact I think all of the men, had done what’s called
National Service. It’s a required two-year service in the military, so they were
all two years older than me. They were much more experienced both in terms
of life and in terms of practical experience in the lab. You know, if you’d
been in the air force and learned how to make radios, you were much better
off [laughter] in the lab than somebody like me.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did you have to teach yourself how to make radio type things?
[00:20:57] I read a lot of books. [laughter] I studied incredibly hard.
22

Marine-Street:

I’m a little confused about how things worked at Oxford. You would go to
these lectures, but it wasn’t student participation type of lecture. Is that
correct?

Chu:

[00:21:19] [laughter] You didn’t ask questions in lectures. It’s this one great
thing about the system. It’s Darwinian. It’s survival of the fittest, because if
you can’t go away and study on your own and teach yourself, you aren’t going
to survive. Or you could go to your tutor in this much more intimate setting
of one-on-one, one-on-two. In physics it was always two students, one tutor,
or one student, one tutor. They guided you through in preparation for the
exams.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

The lectures were just the professor giving information and….
[00:22:06] Yes. You didn’t ask questions. You just took notes.
Did they ever call on you to answer a question in lectures?
[00:22:13] No. Never.
It was just purely presentation on their part.
[00:22:16] Yes. Yes. Yes. Don’t bother the professor.

Marine-Street:

How did you interact, if at all, with the male students in an academic setting?

Chu:

[00:22:24] First of all we had lab sessions where we socialized. The lectures in
my mind were almost a total waste of time because it was seemingly
disorganized and you couldn’t ask questions. There was no interaction. It
wasn’t the time to socialize. But there was always an hour gap between
lectures in the morning. We had lectures back to back to back. Three or four
of us would go and have coffee in town.

Marine-Street:

Tell me about your tutor.
23

Chu:

[00:23:07] [laughter] I was in an all women’s college, so I had a woman tutor
who was a classic British bluestocking. She was unmarried. I can’t imagine
she ever had a boyfriend. She totally devoted her life to her work and
expected me to do the same. [laughter] When I finished my Schools, the final
exams, she asked me to stay on and do a doctorate degree working with her
in the Oxford Observatory. I did that for three years. Then I got engaged to
an American and I think she was heartbroken. She’d hoped I was going to
carry on the tradition of her life at St. Hugh’s. Poor Dr. Madge Adam.

Marine-Street:

I want to try to understand what was going on in the wider world at this time.
1950s, in the United States, the Cold War, of course, was very much in
people’s mind. Was that in your consciousness at all studying physics?

Chu:

[00:24:17] I remember the Russian satellites causing a lot of--I mean it was
scientific competition, the fear that the Western world would be left behind.
Of course, there was still incredible aftermath from the war. As I mentioned,
my hometown, the center of the town, was completely demolished. In
London, the blitz demolished a significant part of London. It took years to
rebuild all of that. As I remember, [for] a number of years after the war there
was food rationing. I remember never seeing a banana or a pineapple, those
kinds of things that couldn’t make their way into the U.K. during the war. We
had ration books and we had little coupons we had to give out to get sugar
and eggs and things.

Marine-Street:

If following in your tutor’s footsteps was not something that was in your life
plan, what were you thinking you might do with this physics education?

24

Chu:

[00:25:38] That’s a good question. I’m going to answer this in a roundabout
way. My great aunt, even though she wasn’t college educated, really nurtured
me through my childhood years. I remember her saying when Sandy--that
was my first husband--gets a better job will you be able to stop working. I
mean, the role models I had were women dependent on men. Women did
not have careers. I certainly was very enthusiastic about getting as much
education as I could. The fact that not only was I the first in my family to go
to college, but I was called Dr. Holmes. That was a source of enormous
pride. I hadn’t thought beyond that.
I wanted to teach. Of course, this is, again, a classic women’s
profession, teaching nursing. I applied for jobs in the United States and my
friends all thought I was crazy. I had the sense of adventure even at that age.
I wanted to explore the world. This great uncle, the one who set me all these
sums, he’d never been outside of Swansea. Amazing. Amazingly cloistered
environment. Anyway, I had a sense I wanted to explore the world. I looked
to coming to live in the United States. Then I married an American. My first
husband was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. He came back to Harvard to do a
PhD and then he came back [to England] and we got married in Oxford.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

You met him when he was at Oxford.
[00:27:41] Yes.
How did you meet?
[00:27:43] We met on that famous ski trip where I had been a waitress in the
summer to earn the money.

25

Marine-Street:

In the U.K. at the time, was there much of a women’s movement? Did you
have a sense of there being any kind of broader movement of women?

Chu:

[00:28:01] No. I’ll give you an example. Women’s consciousness was just on
the cusp of being raised. I played a lot of sports at Oxford. My main sport
was what was called net ball. Basketball in this country. If you were on an
Oxford University team representing the university, men got what were called
blues and women got what were called half blues. It was as if women’s sports
didn’t count. I never thought to ask why aren’t women getting blues. Why are
men getting blues, and women got half blues?
There was also an athletic club called the Vincent’s Club at Oxford, and
it was only open to men blues. [laughter] We never questioned it. It was
absolutely astounding in retrospect. My first consciousness raising came in
the United States. My mother-in-law was a very liberal, forward-thinking
woman. I remember she gave me [laughter] Betty Friedan’s book, and I
remember being shocked. What was she trying to do, disrupt my marriage or
something? [laughter] It’s interesting that the U.K. had a woman prime
minister, and here we are in 2016 before the U.S. is even close to having a
woman president. But I think the women’s movement in this country was
much more energetic.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

Let’s get you to the United States then.
[00:29:58] Yes.
You apply for jobs, but then you’re here for a while as Sandy’s finishing at
Harvard?

26

Chu:

[00:30:09] In classical, unexpected twists and turns of life, I became pregnant
almost [laughter] immediately after we got married. Here I found myself in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. I was on a postdoc. Sandy was a year behind me
getting his PhD. He got a PhD and we moved to Berkeley where I delivered
our first child. I couldn’t cope with moving three thousand miles from
Cambridge to Berkeley, having my first child, and looking for a job, especially
since I knew his position at Berkeley was only going to be a two-year
appointment. Then he got in a position at Stanford as an assistant professor,
and that was when I started thinking of expanding my own career.

Marine-Street:

This seems to me like it would be a giant change for you. You’re coming
from Oxford and you’re ending up in Berkeley during the middle of the
1960s and transitioning into motherhood. Just tell me a little bit about what
that was like.

Chu:

[00:31:29] [laughter] It was overwhelming. It was overwhelming moving to
the U.S. for one thing. You’d think having a common language would be
sufficient to bridge any cultural differences. I remember being bewildered.
For example, if you go to mail a letter in the U.K., there are these nice red
post boxes which are obvious. I didn’t even know how to mail a letter. My
husband was doing his PhD so I didn’t want to bother him with trivia. I
remember [laughter] going to the Harvard Coop, the main store which was
then in 1962 in Harvard Square and I wanted to buy a washcloth. In England
they’re called flannels. I went into the store and said, “Do you have any
flannels?” They looked as if I had come from another planet.

Marine-Street:

Yes. They’ll give you a pair of pajamas. [laughter]
27

Chu:

[00:32:29] [laughter] Yes. Then there’s the contrast of the weather. We came
over on a boat from Southampton to New York. Getting off the boat in New
York, I had on my traditional British summer wear. I’ll never forget what I
had on [laughter]--a gray woolen skirt and a gray sweater. It must have been
ninety-five degrees and ninety-five percent humidity. I thought, how am I
going to survive in this country.
Oh, the other interesting thing. The boat it was almost dominated by a
group of students from Georgia. I could not understand what they said
because of the Georgian accent. Anyway, everything was overwhelming.
Then to get pregnant on top of it. I mean pregnancy, as you know, is a shock
to the system. Then moving across country. We actually drove across the
United States. I don’t recommend doing that when you’re pregnant either.

Marine-Street:

You’re at Berkeley for a few years and then Sandy--does he get recruited to
Stanford?

Chu:

[00:33:53] Yes. He was recruited as an assistant professor. We lived in a small
house in South Palo Alto. One day in Science Magazine I read about William
Shockley, the Nobel Laureate, seeking an assistant to help with some science
teaching project. I thought, what a great way for me to get my feet wet in
academia. I knew I wasn’t good enough to be on the Stanford faculty in
physics, especially since I hadn’t been doing anything for two years. Anyway,
I got this job with William Shockley. It took me three or four months to
realize he was the crazy one and I was not the crazy one, because he had very
outlandish ideas and, as you may know, was criticized for his racist views of
intellect.
28

Fortunately, he had another person working for him who was an
assistant professor at San Jose State. He and I agreed to switch
responsibilities. I taught his class at San Jose State and he took on what I was
doing for William Shockley. I was so glad to get out of that position.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Do you remember what you were doing exactly?
[00:35:33] Trying to design methods to teach science more effectively.
Essentially that’s what it boiled down to. He gave me almost no guidance.
That job was a disaster for me. It turned out to be almost a disaster when I
was subsequently hired at Stanford because some of the African-American
faculty learned I had worked for Bill Shockley and thought I supported his
racist ideas. I was taken aside by a very wonderful African-American faculty
member, Jim Gibbs [James Lowell Gibbs Jr.], who asked me to I explain how
I’d worked for him and could they rely on me not to be supportive of these
racist ideas. It could have been a bad experience all around.

Marine-Street:

When you interviewed with Shockley, did he ask you any kind of crazy
questions? I’ve heard that he did this with engineers. [laughter]

Chu:

[00:36:45] I’m amazed you’ve heard the stories, too. I vividly remember he
telephoned me at our house and I was nursing my daughter who must have
been then--I don’t know--six months old. No, she must have been older than
that. Anyway, I was holding Anne, and Shockley immediately said, “I have a
few questions for you. If you have 137 tennis players in a singles elimination
tournament, how many matches would it take to produce a winner?” I mean
he just wanted me to think on the spot. I wanted to say, “Could we perhaps
have this discussion at a time that’s more convenient?” Anyway, I obviously
29

answered satisfactorily. It was an unexpected question in challenging
circumstances.
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Yes. Interesting. This led you though to San Jose State.
[00:37:46] Yes. Yes. That was good.
Tell me about that.
[00:37:50] It was a great experience in that it was my first exposure--I’m going
to discount my nine months at Harvard as a postdoc because that was an, I
think, unusual circumstance. Here I was suddenly in a working class
environment where many of the students had fulltime jobs. They were, for
the most part, very conscientious students, hardworking, paying their way
through college, circumstances that were novel to me as a Brit. What was
hard was I was replicating my experience at Oxford. I was the only person in
my department who was a woman.
This was an interesting social dynamic divide. There was one AfricanAmerican man and one woman in the department, me. I’ve forgotten his
name. We taught all the freshman physics classes. All the women came to my
class and all the minority students went to his class.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

How interesting.
[00:39:10] Yes. It was as if, understandably, they felt comfortable.
Were there many women students?
[00:39:18] Not many. The ones that were there felt comfortable in coming to
my class.

Marine-Street:

Had you taught physics before at Oxford?

30

Chu:

[00:39:26] I taught in the tutorial system, but it’s very different from standing
up and teaching in front of 250 people. That was quite a challenge.

Marine-Street:

Did you have any sort of a philosophy that guided your teaching or approach
that you used?

Chu:

[00:39:43] I set high standards. I tried to be fair and clear. I was very
conscientious about preparing my lectures. I think I was quite popular with
the students. Then it became [laughter] more challenging because I found I
was pregnant again. There was a five year separation with my children. I
taught until the week my son was born, and went back to teaching. Then I
took the rest of the year off. I had two children. I was commuting from Palo
Alto to San Jose. I had a huge teaching load, six hours of lectures and nine
hours of labs a week, and no TA.
[00:40:43] I had an epiphany one day driving back from San Jose State
thinking I don’t want to live my life this way anymore. I came home and said
to my husband I’m going to resign, and my criterion for finding a job is I can
bike to work. By this time we lived on the Stanford campus. It wasn’t easy
finding a job at Stanford, but six months later I landed on my first job at
Stanford.

Marine-Street:

I want to ask you some more about that, but I want to understand a little bit
about what the Stanford community was like when you came as the spouse of
an assistant professor. Was there any sort of mechanism to integrate you into
the Stanford community? What was that like?

Chu:

[00:41:31] Only through the Physics Department. There were no women on
the faculty. None. I’m talking about physics now. All the socializing was done
31

with the wives. This is actually fascinating historical piece of information for
Stanford. I was told under no circumstances when we had a dinner party--in
those days you gave quite formal dinner parties. Under no circumstances was
I to include anyone from SLAC, the Stanford Linear Accelerator [now SLAC
National Accelerator Laboratory], because there’d been this huge divide in
breaking up the high energy physics lab and the Physics Department and the
founding of the Stanford Linear Accelerator. People didn’t talk to each other.
It’s astounding.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

No kidding.
[00:42:30] Yes. It was quite fascinating. I hope you’ve interviewed Burt
Richter [Burton Richter]. He must have many stories about this.

Marine-Street:

We do have an interview with him. I’m not sure if he talked about the dinner
parties. I’ll have to go and check.

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:42:44] No. I’m sure he talked about the-The divides.
[00:42:47] --cultural divide where people didn’t speak to each other.
Very interesting.
[00:42:52] I remember vividly one dinner party when I found myself seated
between two Nobel Laureates, Felix Bloch, who was the Nobel Laureate in
the Physics Department at Stanford, and Emilio Segré, who was a physicist at
Berkeley. It was daunting

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did you talk about physics?
[00:43:22] Yes. In fact, [laughter] I did. I was still teaching physics at San Jose
State at that point. I can’t remember what problem I gave. I mentioned that
32

my students were having a problem. It was quite an elementary physics
problem, but my dinner partners were not the slightest bit interested in
contributing to how I could help my students understand. It was fascinating.
All I can remember was I was sort of dumbstruck sitting between two Nobel
Laureates. This was my first encounter.
Marine-Street:

Was it pretty typical that as a faculty wife you were expected to throw these
dinners or entertain visitors?

Chu:

[00:44:12] Yes. I remember when I first started teaching at San Jose State, one
of the more established women spouses of a faculty member took me aside
and she said, “You know, you’re going to raise a lot of eyebrows by working.”

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

This is a physics spouse.
[00:44:38] Yes. Right.
Most of the other spouses didn’t work.
[00:44:43] No. I don’t think any of them worked. This was 1966.
I had heard that there was a Stanford Women’s Club that many of the faculty
wives belonged to.

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:45:00] Yes.
Were you involved in that at all?
[00:45:01] I was so busy with two small children, commuting and teaching
that I didn’t do much of that. I liked to play tennis but….

Marine-Street:

The faculty wives didn’t visit you and welcome you with open arms to your
recollection.

Chu:

[00:45:25] I was invited to coffee things occasionally when we first came. But
once I started working I was pretty busy with other things.
33

Marine-Street:

Yes, it sounds like you were. Did the children go to school at all in any of the
Stanford facilities?

Chu:

[00:45:46] Yes. Both my kids went to Bing Nursery School which was
wonderful. My grandchildren, graduates of Bing Nursery School, too.
Wonderful, wonderful history. For me, it’s very nice looking back now
because Peter Bing- Peter Bing was a long-term Stanford trustee--the nursery
school was founded in honor of his mother. I had never any connection with
Peter Bing in those days when I was a young faculty wife, but it was
wonderful to know Peter later on and thank him for all the pleasure and in
his mother’s memory for the Bing Nursery School. Still going strong on
Stanford campus.

INTERVIEWEE:

JEAN H. CHU, INTERVIEW 1 (part 2 of 2)

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

AUGUST 26, 2016

Marine-Street:

We’re resuming after a short break. You had gotten tired of this rat race of
commuting to San Jose and were looking for a job closer to home that you
could bike to.

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:00:40] Yes.
Tell me what happens next.
[00:00:44] I tried to be very proper in not using the Stanford circuit to find a
job, so I patiently went through HR and filed applications. There weren’t
many jobs that were appropriate. Lo and behold, after I think it was five
months I saw this ad for an assistant director of the Center for Teaching and
Learning, and it was working with Professor David Halliburton in the English
Department. I think the appeal of David and me working together was that
he was an English professor. I was a physicist by training.
He was administering two grants. The primary goal of the Danforth
Center for Teaching and Learning was to improve teaching and learning in
Bay Area colleges and universities. The other half of the grant--they were
both soft money--was from the Lillie Endowment. The Lillie Endowment’s
goal was Faculty Renewal in Washington, Oregon and California. It was all
35

based out of Stanford. David and I divvied up these responsibilities. He asked
me for ideas on how I could meet both the Danforth Foundation’s goals and
the Lillie Endowment’s goals with programs in science. We did a couple of
interdisciplinary things which were very interesting.
There was an obvious dearth of women in the sciences. One of the
projects that I’m most proud of as a physicist, was when I decided to try and
explore means of improving the status of women in sciences and engineering.
The obvious place to look was Mills College across the bay, which was an all
women’s college. In 1976, we had a kick-off conference on Educating
Women for Science and Engineering. I think that was the title. It brought
together women faculty from Berkeley and Mills--I don’t think we had any
faculty women at Stanford because there were still very few in 1976, and the
ones that were in place were overwhelmed with responsibilities.
[00:03:34] Anyway, we had this kick-off conference and involved
women from industry and academia. It was sponsored in part by Syntex
Corporation where the person then in charge of development was, I think,
was a chemist. That conference gave birth to another generation of events we
called Expanding Your Horizons. It was a once a year conference for seventh
through twelfth grade young women and their teachers and parents, mostly
mothers. It’s still going strong.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

You’re kidding.
[00:04:23] We now must be in the fifth generation of these conferences. I’m
not sure who funds it at the minute, but NSF got involved and it took off like
wildfire. What I don’t have any data on is what role it played in increasing the
36

number of women in the sciences and engineering, particularly on the faculty.
Certainly at Stanford [laughter] it’s a far cry from when I came in 1962 when
there were zero women on the physics faculty.
Marine-Street:

What made you think of getting this group of women together in a
conference? Why did you think that was a way that this issue should be
approached?

Chu:

[00:05:14] They were all scientists so they all brought a personal background
to it. The goal was to see if we could come up with things in common that
could make a difference. Everybody agreed I think that you have to start at a
very early age. I mean the die is cast almost when you’re a seventh grade
young girl and you got turned off from learning mathematics. That’s why we
started with seventh to twelfth graders hoping it would make a difference.

Marine-Street:

Did anything from your early experience inform the way you approached
this? You talked about your education as a child.

Chu:

[00:06:07] I went to an all girls’ school, and so, you know, the tumultuous
teenage years of raging hormones. We were all in it together, unlike if you’re
in a coed school--the segregation of the sexes. You have your first girlfriend,
boyfriend, when it happens, how it happens. Should girls not come across as
looking so smart? If you’re in an all girls’ environment, you’re the only
students to compare each other with, and some of us needed to be leaders
and be first in our class. That certainly helped develop confidence.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

How did you find these other women to participate in this first conference?
[00:06:52] At Mills I contacted someone in the Development Office, I think it
was, and she introduced me to a wonderful woman, Lenore Blum, who was
37

teaching math at Mills. Lenore and I really hit it off and she knew someone-it was a wonderful ol’ girls’ network--she knew someone at the Lawrence Hall
of Science, Nancy Kreinberg, and Nancy Kreinberg knew somebody else, and
so we all used our networks to bring it all together. It was a wonderful event.
Marine-Street:

It seems to me that it might have been a little bit of a stretch for you to
interpret the Danforth Foundation’s grant to improve education in colleges
to get more women into the sciences. Did anybody push back at you on that,
or did you have freedom?

Chu:

[00:07:46] No. No. I mean this wasn’t the only thing I did. In fact, the Lillie
Endowment program and this Danforth program in a way were
complementary because Faculty Renewal for colleges in Washington, Oregon
and California mainly took place in organizing summer conferences. Of
course, if the summer conferences involved the sciences, then I could bring
in the ideas of underrepresentation of women in science. They were
overlapping interlocking ideas. David and I did a conference was called
Revolutions in Science. As a historian, you will appreciate this. It was about
how revolutions can start at any stage and how you could have revolutions in
science coinciding with revolutions in political thought or the humanities.
They were very stimulating conferences.
Anyway, David and I worked well together, but I was very conscious of
the fact that the position was on two-year money. He was a tenured faculty
member and I was [laughter] an untenured woman then out of a job. Coming
toward the end of my second year somebody in the Stanford administration
said to me you should apply for this job as assistant to President Richard
38

Lyman which is opening up. Bill Stone [William E. Stone], who had had the
job was going off to be the director of the Alumni Association. I thought,
well, why not. One wonderful thing about the work with David Halliburton
through the Center for Teaching and Learning and the Lillie Endowment, it
gave me a perspective on Stanford that was very broad.
[00:10:11] For the summer conferences I had to work with the summer
conference office. I had to work with the dormitories to set up housing and
teaching locations. I had to learn about budgets. I had to work with the
School of Humanities and Sciences because the Danforth and Lillie money
went through the School of Humanities and Sciences. I had this wonderful,
broad exposure to faculty outside of the Physics Department, which was
what I knew best.
I got called for an interview for the job with Dick Lyman and even
though I felt well versed on Stanford in general and how it operated, I was
totally [laughter] taken aback when someone on the search committee said to
me, “So what do you do? You are assistant to the president and you get a call
from an angry alumnus whose son was not admitted to Stanford. How do
you handle that?” That was a question I had not thought of or how to handle
it, so I sort of mumbled my way through. Anyway, I did pass that interview
test because I was called in to be interviewed with Dick Lyman. I think I’d
met him once socially, but it was a very formal interview. I remember toward
the end of the interview he said, “I hear you’re a little feisty.”
I said, “Well, that’s funny. I’ve heard that about you, too.” We
immediately had a little feisty interchange. I think we temperamentally were
39

well suited to each other. He was a British labor historian by training, and I
think his mother was British. I got to know his mother quite well after I’d
started working for Dick. But this was a trial by fire. First of all, I was
succeeding men in the job. There had never been an assistant to the president
who was a woman. Fred Glover [Frederic O. Glover], who was, I think, the
predecessor of Bill Stone, was rumored to have said, “That is no job for a
lady.” So there I was in this job. Bill was off busy being head of the Alumni
Association so he had very little time for training me on the job. The first
thing I had to do, every day, was go through Dick’s mail. He had this rather
fierce secretary, Evelyn Betterton, an unmarried woman who was totally
devoted to Dick, incredibly devoted to her job. She would open his mail, date
stamp it, put it in a folder, and there I had this pile of mail every morning and
I had to decide what to do with it. [sigh].
[00:13:39] When you haven’t had exposure to major university
problems, it’s hard to know how to begin tackling some of these questions.
Anyway, I learned on the job. That was a toughie. The other thing I learned
was the pressure of the job. There’s always the unexpected. There was an
assistant provost who worked up above me in Building 10 called Ed Shaw
[Edward S. Shaw]. He came into my office one day and said something like,
“If you’re inbox is empty, you’re not doing a good job.”
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[laughter]
[00:14:28] Meaning, you know, I had gotten rid of problems too quickly.
[laughter] Anyway, I worked incredibly hard at that job. This was 1977. I
worked for Dick for three years learning as I went. He went off in 1980 to be
40

president of the Rockefeller Foundation. For three years I’d had a bird’s eye
view every single day of this man who had gone through a lot at Stanford.
The previous president, Pitzer [Kenneth Sanborn Pitzer] had lasted eighteen
months. It was the Vietnam War crisis. Of course, I was not there with Dick
at that time, but he was honed on the job. He’d been provost at Stanford so
he brought a wealth of experience. I just learned by watching. I sat in on staff
meetings.
We used to have cabinet meetings I think it was every Monday
morning. Then there were regular meetings with the vice president for
development who decided what were priorities on his calendar. I had to make
some of these things happen. But I just watched Dick and how he acted, how
he responded in crises. I remember one day vividly. I had a problem that I
needed to talk to him about, and he said, “I’m sorry. I can’t talk about that
now. I’m in computer overload.” It was the first time I think I’d ever seen
anybody in a job where it was just too much for a human being to deal with.
It was eye-opening. Anyway, I was not surprised, although sad, that he was
chosen as president of the Rockefeller Foundation. I did have a chance to go
to New York with him, but it just didn’t fit in with my personal life.
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

There are lot of questions I want to ask you about this.
[00:16:54] Yes.
Why would Fred Glover say, “This is no job for a lady?”
[00:17:01] I think you take a lot of fire. He was being a protectionist
gentleman. You take a lot of abuse in that job. You get angry people. In 1977
you went in the main door of Building 10 which had on it “President’s and
41

Provost Office.” I think they’ve taken it off the door now so that [laughter]
any angry person can’t walk in. The first door on the left as you come in was
mine. People would come in. To answer your question, Fred was trying to
protect me from abuse and anger and maybe thought I wasn’t physically up
to it, although I think I was [laughter] as physically up to it as he was.
One day it was lunchtime. I very rarely took lunch so I was in the
office. The only other person in the office was the receptionist at the front
desk. She came into my office saying there’s somebody demanding to speak
to the highest-ranking person in the office. I said, “Well, I guess that’s me
right now.” This person came in. It was a mind-blowing experience. It was a
tall person with a beard, a tight red sweater with fairly well-endowed breasts,
tight jeans, and high heels and big bag. I said, “Please have a seat.” His basic
complaint was that he’d been turned away from the hospital for refusing to
have transsexual surgery.
I mean, how do you deal with this? Nothing in my life had prepared me
to deal with this kind of emergency. He had this ominous looking bag sitting
on his lap. Then I said, “Well, let me see if I can get someone in the Medical
School to talk to you,” or some calming words.
He said, “Lady, I am homicidal. I need help fast.”
I said, “Just sit here.” I went outside to the receptionist and said, “Call
the police. Get them here as fast as possible.” This was just before the quad
was paved. The police cars drove into the quad, drove up outside Building 10.
The person turned around, saw the police car, and started running out of the
quad. Of all the times I wanted a woman police officer, this was not the time.
42

It was a woman police officer and she was very smart. She said, “Don’t
worry. He’ll trip on those high heels.” That’s exactly what happened. He
tripped going down the steps, and the last I saw of him he was arrested and
carried away. [laughter] Then I was scared.
Marv Herrington [Marvin Herrington], who was chief of police or
director of public safety--I think that is the euphemism--insisted on having an
emergency button put under my desk for the future. So that is one anecdote
[to explain what] Fred Glover [said]. Of course, maybe in Fred Glover’s day
they didn’t have people wanting transsexual surgery, but I think the point he
was making was the job is full of the unexpected. It’s sometimes physically
threatening, and women shouldn’t be in it. [laughter]
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

That’s certainly a memorable experience.
[00:20:56] Yes. It was a memorable experience.
I just want to clarify. The individual had wanted transsexual surgery and the
hospital--

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:21:03] Yes. He’d been denied it. Yes.
Interesting.
[00:21:07] These were the early days of transsexual surgery.
I was going to say, it must have been very early.
[00:21:13] To answer your question about “that is no job for a lady” in
another way--Dick was a wonderful, wonderful man. I learned a huge amount
from watching him, but he did not suffer fools gladly. He was sometimes
very harsh in the way he treated staff members. In fact, one quite senior staff

43

member said to me in private one day, “I don’t know how you can cope with
working with him. He’s so demanding that he makes me dysfunctional.”
I said, “Well, you know, I have the advantage of being around him all
the time, and I see the ups and down. You see the pressures on people.” Fred
saw both sides, the pressure you got from the unexpected, from the general
public, and then the pressure you got from dealing with people who were
constantly under great stress themselves.
Marine-Street:

Do you have an example you can think of of the kind of demanding boss that
he was?

Chu:

[00:22:37] He would come across as short-tempered sometimes if people
weren’t prepared. That’s the other thing I learned on the job [laughter], it’s
the Girl Scout motto, “Be prepared”. If you want to defend the position you
be sure to have done your homework. Sometimes there were staff members
who hadn’t prepared as thoroughly as they might and it was a waste of his
time.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Was this a nine to five job?
[00:23:10] No. [laughter] It was not a nine to five job. In fact, I remember one
day. I used to usually go into the office on Saturday morning after my tennis
game. I was sitting there one day sitting in my tennis warm-up suit. Of
course, you had to have a key into Building 10 at the weekend. One of the
women lawyers who worked in Building 170 came in through Building 10,
and she said, “Huh. So I see you’re still working at it,” or something. Then I
was relatively new on the job. She said, “Let me tell you. Don’t ever expect
anybody to say you’re doing a good job because it’s not going to happen.”
44

You know, again, you had to be very self-sufficient and be able to take the
rough patches as they came along.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

What types of letters did he get? What sorts of demands were made on him?
[00:24:14] Oh, it was all over the map. Today I’m sure it’s incredibly different
because people do such a lot of business by e-mail. These were all written,
formal things. They could be alumni with a complaint. I can remember--I am
not going to name the faculty member, but there was this angry alumnus
saying that Professor X was a discredit to Stanford, that she had been at some
event and described in detail how she was a poor representative of the
university. There was that kind of problem. There were complaints from
students [laughter] about everything under the sun.
There was [laughter] one young man who used to come regularly to my
office wanting me to support this movement among students that you should
be a virgin until married. [laughter] There would be angry faculty. One day an
elderly faculty came and sat in my office and saying, “When Wally [Wallace
Sterling] was president”--this was Wallace Sterling who was Dick’s
predecessor--”you could come in here at any time of the day and Wally would
sit and chew the cud with you. And I now have to make an appointment two
weeks in advance.” So you would have to placate them.
Then there would be staffers. This is a story I don’t feel shy about
relating. I got a telephone call from a faculty member in Engineering
complaining bitterly about the laborious hiring process at Stanford. This was
Hank Riggs [Henry E. “Hank” Riggs] who went on to be vice president of
development and president at Harvey Mudd. This was a hard-driving,
45

forward-looking faculty member who thought Stanford’s ways were archaic.
There would be community members complaining, “Why can’t we have
access to Stanford foothills.” Government relations. I mean they came right,
left and center, flying, flying, flying. As you can understand when you’re new,
your first day on the job, you aren’t prepared for any of these assaults or how
you decide to negotiate them.
Marine-Street:

Did you have some principles that you used to navigate your way through
this job?

Chu:

[00:27:25] Always be fair, be courteous. As somebody who interviewed me
for the job said, “This job requires grace under pressure. [laughter] Always be
gracious.” Learn as much as you can about your community. The more
faculty I knew, the better it was because I always had somebody to turn to for
advice. That was the wonderful thing about the job. Yes, I was assaulted
through Dick’s mail right, left and center, but I always had someone to turn
to. There was always somebody who knew how best to navigate these
problems.
Of course, it was a big juggling act if you had fifty letters in a day and
they all came from right, left and center. So, no, it was not a nine to five job.
You asked for an example of how he was demanding. I would get a call at
home on Sunday morning saying, “I need, this, this and this. Why am I doing
this tomorrow? Why don’t I have the background preparation for this?” It
was a tough job, but it was a wonderful job. It was incremental in my career
through Stanford’s procedures.

46

Marine-Street:

You not only were in charge of setting his calendar and prioritizing but
interfacing with other people who provided information that he needed and
making sure that they did a good job before it got filtered to him?

Chu:

[00:29:24] Right. Evelyn Betterton, his secretary--I think they don’t call them
secretaries anymore [laughter]--but she was called secretary. Evelyn kept his
calendar. She, as I said, was devoted to him and nothing was too much
problem. There were these regular meetings of the vice presidents. Stanford
seems to have had an exponential increase in vice presidents these days.
[laughter] I notice almost everybody is assistant vice president for this or this
or this. There was a vice president for business and finance. The provost was
the senior vice president, the vice president for development, and then the
deans of the seven schools. We used to meet regularly so I got exposed to the
kind of issues that were priorities for them. The development office was very
good about prioritizing for Dick --I mean, development, raising money, is a
big factor in a president’s life.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Would you get special visitors a lot?
[00:30:35] Oh, yes. [laughter] It was in Dick’s time that the Queen of England
came. The Emperor of Japan came.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Yes.
[00:30:55] Then there was a director of public events, Lois Wagner, who dealt
with all the VIP visitors. They all have to be coordinated. If you were the
queen or head of state coming, the security in advance is quite formidable.

Marine-Street:

That’s my question about this. I was thinking about these important visitors,
ex-President Ford’s coming when you were Dick’s assistant, et cetera. There
47

must have been a lot of protocol surrounding this. Did protocol come under
your purview or were there people you relied on to help you with some of it?
Chu:

[00:31:38] No. There were people I relied on. I think somebody [laughter]
described me as a cog between all the big wheels. It wasn’t a very
complimentary description, but I understood what he meant. You just need
to make sure everything is functioning well.

Marine-Street:

I wanted to ask you about the students and their interactions with President
Lyman. I want to back up a little bit to before you started working for him.
You were at Stanford, or at least Sandy was working at Stanford and you were
living nearby during the late 1960s, early 1970s, during this real time of
antiwar protest and quite strife at Stanford. I wonder if you could tell me,
from your perspective, how you witnessed those years.

Chu:

[00:32:38] Remember, I was mother of two children and working fulltime and
commuting, so I wasn’t as engaged in Stanford. By 1975 when I started
working at Stanford, it was all over, essentially. I remember John Schwartz,
who was the general counsel, had on his desk a big rock that had been
thrown through a window. There was a lot of vandalism. Windows were
boarded up. The other issue I remember--there was a big move among
students for South African divestment.
Oh, this was actually a very funny. I came to work one morning. I used
to get to work around eight o’clock. By the time I got there, there was a big
ring of students arm-in-arm around Building 10. The police were there. All
the people who worked in Building 10 were locked out. What to do? John
Schwartz, the general counsel, after some discussion with other people, came
48

up to me and said, “It’s your job to go to the front door and say to the
students, ‘My name is Jean Fetter. I work in this building. Please allow me
access to my office.’” The thought was they were going to say, “No. We’re
protesting, blah, blah, blah,” and they’d be arrested. I said, “Okay.”
I went up to the door, repeated my words, and to my amazement, they
parted and allowed me to put my key in the lock and in I went. Now I was in
the building and everybody else was outside the building. [laughter] What was
I supposed to do there? Of course, it was before the days of cell phones so
we couldn’t communicate. Then when John Schwartz saw what had
happened to me, everybody who worked in Building 10 did the same thing I
did. Soon we were all in the building and the students--I don’t think any of
them were arrested--but, anyway, that was the student protest about divesting
from companies, corporations that did business in South Africa.
Marine-Street:

I found a picture in The Daily. It looks like the students actually were in the
office while you were there. [shows newspaper article and picture]

Chu:
Marine-Street:

[00:35:51] Oh, yes. They did come in and sit in the office at one point. Yes.
I wondered if you could tell me about that day. This would have been in
1978.

Chu:
Marine-Street:

[00:35:59] Let’s see. This was 1978.
Do you remember that day at all? I was wondering if you could narrate it for
us if you do.

Chu:

[00:36:15] [reading newspaper article] It went on for more than seven hours.
[laughter] I told the group I thought President Lyman would be more than
happy to meet with them when he returned from the East. Yes. I have a very
49

vague recollection of that story [laughter] which I suppose is indicative of
[laughter] where this fell in my memories of the challenges of working at
Stanford.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[laughter] It was just another day at the office maybe.
[00:36:55] One of the other senior staff members was laughing at me
afterwards because I said I didn’t think discussion could serve any
constructive purpose. He said, “No point in using logic with these people.
They would just laugh it off.” I don’t remember how it unfolded to tell you
the truth.

Marine-Street:

I was wondering how they managed to all get in there. The other thing the
story mentions is that you all set up a conference call so that he could talk to
the students. He was in New York and there’s a picture of the students there
around a conference table.

Chu:

[00:37:41] I only vaguely remember that. The anecdote I just told about my
“name is Jean Fetter, please allow me access to my office,” that made a big
impression on me because I was stuck inside the building with all these angry
people outside, not knowing what to do. I’d only been on the job a year and a
half then.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

Your first major protest movement perhaps.
[00:38:10] Yes. My first major protest movement.
This is not the first time President Lyman would have encountered student
protests.

Chu:

[00:38:18] No. No.

50

Marine-Street:

In fact, many people I’ve talked to give him a lot of credit for how he dealt
with the student protestors in an earlier time. I was just wondering if you had
a kind of protocol at the office, or what his thought was, about how do you
deal with student protestors.

Chu:

[00:38:38] I’ll go back to what I said earlier. You try to be fair, you try to be
even-handed, polite, listen to people. That young man who regularly would
come to my office about “we need to be virgins until marriage”--I can’t
remember what the movement was called--there were moments when I really
wanted to laugh at his earnestness, but you have to sit there and wait it out.
No, we didn’t have any written protocol but I watched how Dick acted
with people. When you work with somebody for quite a while and you see
how they act under different circumstances, you sort of automatically mimic
what they do. But you’re never prepared for certain events. Right? The guy
who came in to my office, the transsexual, no protocol would have prepared
me for that. I was in a state of shock. I actually shook afterwards. When he
said, “Lady, I’m homicidal,” I mean I felt physically threatened by that.

Marine-Street:

It reminds me of something else that happened while you were working for
President Lyman. A professor in the Math Department was murdered.

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:40:10] Oh, yes. Karel deLeeuw. Yes.
I wondered if you had any recollections of that.
[00:40:14] I knew Karel. That was devastating. Absolutely devastating. There
was also somebody who was murdered in the church. I think it was a
graduate student wife. I don’t want to go into the details. It was gory, a
gruesome murder. Campuses, especially Stanford, where the worst violence
51

you have is stealing a bicycle. We were unprepared for that. I must say I’m
sympathetic on a national scale with how the president of the United States
deals with these growing numbers of incidents of violence nationwide. They
pop up unexpectedly. You’re never prepared for what’s going to happen.
Marine-Street:

It seems as though despite these threats and worries, you sort of had an open
door.

Chu:

[00:41:19] Yes. An open door into Building 10. I haven’t walked by Building
10 in months. But I seem to remember the last time I walked by they had
taken “President’s and Provost’s Office” off the door because it’s like a
magnet. You know, people want to protest about something, this is the place
to go.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

What was President Lyman like when he dealt with students?
[00:41:54] He was a very analytical thinker, and he was very direct. I think-tying this back to the person who said “he makes me dysfunctional when I’m
around him because he’s so highly demanding and doesn’t bring out the best
in me”--I think that was a reflection of the fact that he spoke his mind, which
I found valuable. It’s wonderful, [laughter] especially when you see politicians
today. You knew where you stood with him.

Marine-Street:

He decides that he’s going to go off to New York to work with the
Rockefeller.

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:42:41] Yes.
You decide you’re not going to go. What happens next with you?
[00:42:47] One of the other senior staffers who worked in Building 10 was
Jerry Lieberman [Gerald Lieberman], who was made vice provost, dean of
52

graduate studies and research. He had an office upstairs from me in Building
10. Jerry and I became very good friends. We used to bike home. I always
used to bike back and forth to work and so did Jerry. We used to bike along
Alvarado Road together and have these nice conversations. When Dick left-Don Kennedy was appointed president. Don was very courteous and
thoughtful. He came and said, “Would you like to stay on as my assistant?”
I said, “Don, this is a very personal relationship. You have to have your
own assistant.” So I was out of a job essentially. I think he and Jerry had
talked, because Jerry came and said, “I’m taking on these new responsibilities
in graduate studies and research.” They merged the office. It used to be Vice
Provost of Graduate Studies and Dean of Research. I don’t remember the
date when they were merged. He offered me the job as one of his Associate
Deans. I was taken aback, but thrilled because I liked him. I wanted to stay
working at Stanford and so I accepted. Then I moved next door, to Building
1 where I had an office upstairs with three assistant deans.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

What types of things were you supposed to be doing in this new role?
[00:44:34] [laughter] Jerry had some well-defined things, but at the end of the
job description it said, “…and miscellaneous responsibilities,” which meant
he could throw anything he wanted my way. The major position was to
oversee the recruitment of women and minorities to graduate programs at
Stanford, and that’s why I had three assistant deans working with me. One
was African-American, one was Mexican-American, and one was NativeAmerican Indian. Ann Medicine, the Native-American, died subsequently.

53

Unfortunately, like many Native-Americans, she had childhood diabetes and
died quite young.
That was a challenging job for Ann, but because Native-American
students were not always well prepared for graduate programs, especially at a
place as selective as Stanford. That was a big job. I continued my interest in
women in science and I took personal responsibility for the recruitment of
women into science and engineering programs at Stanford. I didn’t do that
single-handedly. There was someone in the Law School, for example,
LaDoris Cordell, who worked with minorities and women in the Law School,
someone else in the Medical School. It was a sort of oversight committee, but
I took main responsibility for H&S [Humanities and Sciences] and
Engineering.
Then the other big responsibility, which was not part of the job when I
took it, arose because of one of the problems Jerry threw my way. There was
no formal graduate student grievance procedure. As you might well believe,
with 8,000 graduate students at Stanford, many of them have grievances, and
some of them can’t be resolved informally. So, working with Iris Brest in the
general counsel’s office, I developed this graduate student grievance
procedure. [laughter] My job with Dick trained me well for that because it
was a variation, in a focused way, of all the things I’d seen in Building 10.
Marine-Street:

Let’s talk about the graduate student grievance procedure a little bit more.
Do you recall what you and Iris came up with? Were there any principles that
you thought should be involved in a grievance procedure?

54

Chu:

[00:47:31] One of the issues that became apparent is that Graduate Student A
in Department X complains to the department chairman. The department
chairman makes some ruling. The student doesn’t like it so the student goes
to the dean of the school. The dean makes some ruling, which could be the
same as the department chair. The student doesn’t like it and goes to the
provost. The provost--so you get the sense. There’s this hierarchy of appeal
and there’s never any resolution. One of the things we wanted to do was sort
of terminate how many times you could grieve and who had the authority to
be definitive. We ruled out steps. I think it went department chairman, school
dean, and then it stopped at vice provost for graduate studies and research.
That was one principle.
The other principle was everything had to be above board. If a student
grieved about a faculty member, the faculty member was to be fully informed
of the grievance. Everything was open. You couldn’t have these anonymous
gripes against people for things that you couldn’t investigate.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Were the gripes typically related to evaluation of graduate work?
[00:49:06] The ones I remember were quibbles about academic evaluation
when the students felt they’d been unfairly treated. There was one terrible
incident in one department in H&S where the student was mentally unstable
and complained about harassment. It wasn’t an academic issue; it was
harassment by the department. What it boiled down to was that the
department didn’t know how to deal with somebody who was unstable.

Marine-Street:

Were allegations of sexual harassment treated through this grievance
procedure?
55

Chu:

[00:49:55] I don’t remember any. Sexual harassment became a big issue ten
years later. I think there were incidents of sexual harassment, but these were
academic grievances. I don’t remember ever seeing any sexual harassment
issue until the early 1990s.

Marine-Street:

That might make sense historically. Let’s talk about the recruitment efforts
for the women in science. How did you go about this?

Chu:

[00:50:42] A number of avenues. One was publications. I produced--I have
no idea where my copy is--a booklet called Women in Science and Engineering at
Stanford. I can’t remember how we limited it because it was quite expensive. I
think it was if you were admitted to a department you were sent a copy of this
very nice booklet which profiled women in the sciences and engineering at
Stanford. That took a long time to put together. The other thing I did, and
the minority deans did variations on this, too, was visits. I visited Smith,
Mount Holyoke, Wellesley, you know, the traditional women’s colleges, as
well as highly selective general coeducational institutions, talking about
Stanford in the sciences. Not that it needs much talking up.
I think women, in particular, needed encouragement to think about
coming to Stanford, as did minorities. Then we coordinated with departments
on how they went about recruiting. So it was a joint effort. But it’s a big job.
You’re not dealing just nationally. I didn’t ever do any international travel, but
some of the departments in Engineering, the whole department could be
international students. Petroleum engineering, for example, many come from
the Middle East.

56

Marine-Street:

It seems like the departments for graduate admissions each have their own
sort of different procedures. Was it like that then? Was there ever any effort
to standardize it, or to at least make it more transparent?

Chu:

[00:52:49] Standardize. No, I don’t think we made any effort to standardize. I
think the departments were all aware of the efforts that went on under Jerry
Lieberman. Again, it’s communication within the university.

Marine-Street:

When you would meet with the different schools and go out and find
promising, potential graduate students, would you then try to connect them
with an individual faculty member, or just more of an awareness?

Chu:

[00:53:25] No. It was much more generic in its approach. And the minority
deans all had their own networks, particularly the Native-American dean.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

Right, where they would find out about promising students?
[00:53:43] Yes.
Did Jerry Lieberman’s office get into preparation of students, ones who were
maybe really promising but they needed a little bit extra work to be able to
handle a graduate program?

Chu:

[00:53:55] No. We had minority graduate student fellowships. There was a
financial incentive from the dean’s office to the departments to help finance
minority graduate students.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

Was that money federal, do you remember, or was this internal?
[00:54:19] I think it was internal. You’re really testing my memory. [laughter]
Yes. I know it was a long time ago. Tell me just a little bit about what Jerry
Lieberman was like.

57

Chu:

[00:54:32] Jerry was the most wonderful, wise, even-handed person--I never
saw him lose his cool temper. He was incredibly supportive of his staff. I was
really blessed. He and Dick Lyman got on incredibly well together, but they
were very different personalities. Jerry was New York born and raised. He
had a wonderful loving wife, Helen, and his children he adored. He would do
anything for his children. I remember [laughter] when I would go to him with
some problem and he’d say, “What’s the bottom line here?” Yes. “I trust you.
I know you have a problem. What’s the bottom line?” Then he would do
what he could to support you to get out of it.
One day I went to him. I was at my wit’s end. I won’t go into the
details. I said, “Jerry, I can’t do this job any longer. It is really taking its toll on
me.” Instead of berating me or saying, “Oh, come on. You can do it,” he just
sat there and listened and said, “Yeah, this is a really tough assignment. I
understand what you’re going through. And if it’s time for you to go, you
have to do what you think is best.” Of course, then I said, “Jerry, of course,
I’ll stay and help you.” We got over it. He also would have a weekly staff
meeting. Let’s see, there were Pat Devaney [Patricia L. Devaney], me, Al
Gelpi [Albert Gelpi], who was a faculty member in English, and Karlene
Dickey, who oversaw all the graduate student applications, financial aid
things. That was a huge job.
We would all go for an hour once a week into Jerry’s office. He would
always provide something nice to eat. I think we had a glass of wine. It was
like five o’clock in the evening. We told him what had been going on in our
lives that week, and he provided cheer and support. Oh, he was just
58

incredible. I can’t remember anybody, any faculty member who had a bad
word to say about Jerry. He was really loved. He, of course, went on to be
provost under Gerhard Casper, and continued to be helpful to me when I
went on to be dean of admissions. When I had a big problem, Jerry was the
first person I would think to call on.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Okay.
[00:57:49] Wonderful. Jerry, I hope you’re listening to this. [laughter]

INTERVIEWER:

NATALIE MARINE-STREET

INTERVIEWEE:

JEAN H. CHU, INTERVIEW 2 (part 1 of 2)

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

AUGUST 30, 2016

Marine-Street: This is Natalie Marine-Street with the Stanford Historical Society’s Oral
History Program. Today is August 30, 2016. I’m here again with Jean Chu,
and we are performing the second part of the oral history interview. Jean, we
covered a lot last time and we ended with your work with Jerry Lieberman
[Gerald J. Lieberman]
Chu: [00:00:55] I was associate dean of Graduate Studies and Research.
Marine-Street:

This would have been in the early 1980s I suppose.

Chu: [00:01:04] 1980 to 1984. Yes.
Marine-Street: Were there many other women in that kind of a senior level management
position at Stanford?
Chu: [00:01:11] Pat Devaney [Patricia L. Devaney] was an associate dean at the
same time I was. There were no deans of schools who were women. That’s
the senior level position. When I was assistant to Dick Lyman [Richard W.
Lyman] I think I was among the senior women in the university. Sally
Mahoney, who was registrar, was also sort of a leading woman.
Marine-Street:

Did the university at that time have any kind of programs or efforts to try to
get more women into management positions?
61

Chu: [00:01:51] The short answer is not really. I was in the first class of what was
called the management development program. It was fifteen or twenty
people--I’m not even sure how they were selected--who were in midmanagement positions who the university had somehow identified as going
on to other management positions. There was one other woman I remember,
Cecilia Burciaga, who’s since died. She left Stanford and went to work
elsewhere. It was people like John Ford, who was then associate vicepresident for development, who went on to be vice-president for
development, Andy Doty [Andrew Doty] in public affairs, and me from the
president’s office. It wasn’t specifically geared to women.
Marine-Street: What kind of things did they do in the management development program
that you can recall? I know it was a long time ago.
Chu: [00:03:00] [laughter] There were leadership tests. I think we all had to take
some kind of personality test. They gave us tasks. The one I remember vividly
[laughter] was you are in a plane crash in the Mojave Desert and the plane
goes down and you’re left in 120 degree heat. What do you do? There was a
small group of us who were very vocal who said we would wait till it got dark
and then we would march out. The other group which was a little more timid
said--I perceived it as timid since I was in the aggressive group--that they
would stay by the plane and wait to be rescued. The person who was leading
this discussion said, “Well, of course, you should stay by the plane.” It was
essentially providing a problem to a group of people and helping them come
to some consensus.

62

I still laughed years later with one of the people who was in the
program who said, “You dragged me kicking and screaming from that plane.”
[laughter] It was that kind of leadership exercise. There was always somebody
new leading the discussion. I think they met once a week. It was, as I said, not
specifically geared to women. The main sustenance I got from women was
this self-founded group started by Amy Blue [Amy J. Blue]. I don’t remember
what her title was. She worked in Land and Buildings. Amy corralled a group
of eight or ten of us to meet for lunch once a month. That group, believe it
not, is still going forty years later.
Marine-Street: No kidding.
Chu: [00:05:03] Yes. Amy died tragically of a brain tumor. The rest of us are still
going.
Marine-Street: Would you describe it as a friendship group?
Chu: [00:05:15] It’s a friendship formed on common experience of being women in
isolated positions in management. Susan Schofield, Pat Devaney, me, Carol
Marchick [Carol Marchick-Dressler], and Cecilia Burciaga were in the group.
Cecilia also subsequently died unfortunately. And then there’s Margaret Ann
Fidler who was in Student Affairs. I don’t think Margaret Ann was part of the
original group but she joined a few years later, and there is Marlene Wine who
was Don Kennedy’s [Donald Kennedy] assistant and Kathy Ku who is still
working at Stanford. We take turns. We have a schedule. I’m the scheduler
this year. We meet once a month for lunch or a light evening meal. It’s really
wonderful. We continue to support each other, although we are all at
different phases in our lives now.
63

Marine-Street: That’s great. Tell me what you mean when you said “women that were in
isolated management positions.”
Chu: [00:06:24] I was in the president’s office. Pat Devaney worked for the dean of
research at that point. Susan Schofield worked in Humanities and Sciences.
We were scattered in different units throughout the university so there was
nobody within your immediate office who was a supporter.
Marine-Street: You were all at a similar level in terms of hierarchy level?
Chu: [00:06:51] Yes. Yes.
Marine-Street: When you started in these management positions, did you feel there was a
male-oriented culture in academic administration?
Chu: [00:07:07] It was male-oriented by the fact that they there were all men. I
don’t think it was discriminatory. I just think women had not yet moved into
management positions. I mean the challenges of being a woman on the
faculty in the 1970s, 1980s, the challenges were formidable. There wasn’t
well-organized childcare. The societal expectations were different. They were
striving to get tenure. To go into an administrative position on top of all that
was almost asking too much. In a way, you know, it was hard deciding to
leave physics but it turned out for the better for me because I didn’t have
those stresses of tenure and doing research. And I was lucky enough to live
within biking distance of my office.
Marine-Street: Tell me a little bit about your decision to leave Jerry Lieberman’s office and
what came next for you.
Chu: [00:08:31] This came about in 1984 because the then dean of admissions,
Fred Hargadon resigned his position at Stanford to work at the College Board
64

in New York. So Stanford, as usual, the president appointed a search
committee of very distinguished faculty members. I think there were half a
dozen of them. Three I remember from the committee partly because of
questions they asked me. I don’t know whether it was Jerry who encouraged
me to apply for it. Somebody did. I got into the pool and, to my amazement,
was selected even though I’d never set foot in an admissions office.
I think what was appealing was the fact that I had an academic
background. That was atypical in the consortium of financing higher
education, which was an organization of the thirty-five top institutions in the
United States. One guy at Princeton who overlapped with me had a PhD in
music, but we were the outliers. I think that was appealing to the faculty
rather than having someone who had done an MA in education and then
moved into administration.
Marine-Street: As long as that admissions job interview was so memorable, what were some
of the questions they asked you?
Chu: [00:10:14] I have to give a little background before I [answer] this question.
When you read an application--and I’m going to grossly over-simplify--the
first thing you look at is the academic profile of a student, and they’re rated
on a score of one to five, one being high and five being low. Similarly, since
Stanford gets so many well- qualified academic students, there’s this
supplementary criterion that we looked at which was extracurricular activities.
It too was rated on a score of one to five, one being high and five being low.
One of the faculty interviewers said to me, “Would you ever consider
admitting a one/five?” It was a very leading question because what it meant
65

was [someone] focused entirely on academics and [not on] the extracurricular
activities---which means art, music, drama, dance, athletics, public service,
anything that you do outside of the classroom. “Would you consider
admitting a one/five?” My answer was, “Yes, if you had a brilliant young
scholar applying to Stanford.” I learned afterwards that behind that question
was the concern of the faculty that Stanford was focused too much on the
well-rounded student, not the three/three, but the one/three and the
two/three, people who’d done everything, well rounded as opposed to
angular or pointed students.
Marine-Street: Is that the word that they used, angular or pointed?
Chu: [00:11:58] Yes. The word angular was used.
Marine-Street: Describe again what angular would mean.
Chu: [00:12:08] If someone is very highly distinguished academically but is a nerd.
They don’t do much else but would be identified as a child prodigy
academically.
Marine-Street: Was the angularity specifically for [certain] subjects or were there other areas?
Chu: [00:12:32] I was offered the job, I accepted it, and I was immediately
[laughter] bombarded with advice from faculty. I knew quite a lot of faculty
from my other jobs, so they weren’t shy about giving me advice. One, a
faculty member in statistics, Brad Efron [Bradley Efron], came and chewed
my ear and said he wanted mathematics considered in admissions as we
considered athletics. After a number of discussions, I think we agreed that we
would identify 100 very talented mathematicians in the applicant pool. We’d

66

give the files to the faculty in the Math Department and the faculty would
rate them like athletic recruits.
Marine-Street: Interesting.
Chu: [00:13:34] That made them very happy because they felt they’d been heard
and they were happy to be part of a process. And it took the criticism off me
that we were focused on admitting well-rounded students.
Marine-Street: Do you remember the outcomes from that experiment or that new initiative?
Chu: [00:14:00] There’s no equivalent of a Nobel Prize in math. There’s something
called the Fields Medal, which comes much later in life. I’ve never done any
tracking on whether any of those students got Fields Medals. They were in
Math Olympiad competitions, but the most important thing to me was that
the faculty in the Math Department felt happy that they had the material they
wanted to work with, just as the coaches did.
Marine-Street: Were there any other areas?
Chu: [00:15:08] Yes. We broadened it to include faculty in music, art, drama and
dance. We encouraged students either to come and audition in those fields, or
to submit portfolios as part of their application. I was very enthusiastic about
engaging faculty more in the admissions process.
Marine-Street: Had there been a specific overture from faculty in the arts do you recall?
How did that come about?
Chu: [00:15:45] There was one faculty member in particular, Elliot Eisner, who’s in
the School of Education but who was a specialist in art education who
wanted more focus on art. The other faculty were very happy to go along
with this idea of recruiting talented students. I was always enthused about
67

admitting a Yo-Yo Ma cellist who went to Harvard. In fact, there was a young
pianist who was a transfer student from Foothill College who went on to win
an international piano competition.
Marine-Street: Oh, my.
Chu: [00:16:35] It was thrilling to see all these students, these young talents,
suddenly blossom.
Marine-Street: Just to clarify, do you mean Yo-Yo Ma, the cellist, was an application that you
saw, or someone like his quality?
Chu: [00:16:48] No, no, no. I thought if Harvard can get a Yo-Yo Ma, why can’t
Stanford have a Yo-Yo Ma.
Marine-Street: A Yo-Yo Ma-like cellist. I see what you’re saying. Okay.
Chu: [00:16:58] Yes. Yes. The initial push was mathematics, and then it expanded
to art, music, drama, and dance. I don’t know if these programs continued.
I’m very little in touch with the admissions office, as is rightly so. [laughter]
It’s another generation. They should do their own thing.
Marine-Street: Let’s back up a little bit. When you got this job, what was the reaction of
people who knew you?
Chu: [00:17:37] Oh. [laughter] That was interesting. Of course I felt incredibly
honored to get the job, and along with this sense of honor was this sudden
gripping of terror thinking, “Oh, my god, what am I doing? What have I let
myself in for?” The day after the announcement of my position, The Daily had
a cartoon of me standing in a large pair of man’s shoes. My predecessor, Fred
Hargadon, was much beloved at Stanford. I would almost say a cult figure. I
think the caption of the cartoon was something like “Large shoes to fill,” or
68

something. I was a little disheartened by that reaction, you know, as if I
couldn’t fill it. It was enough to be the first woman in the job, and then the
expectation was that I wasn’t going to be able to fill those shoes.
Then a couple of days later, some women students wrote letters to The
Daily complaining of the sexism of the remark, the sexism of the cartoon, and
why didn’t they give me a chance to see how I could perform. That was one
reaction of the students.
I want to continue on this theme of students for a minute because the
first couple of years in the job was very tough on a personal level. There were
some reports about this angularity. Every week I got a number of invitations
to go to dorms to meet with students, which I loved doing. I mean they’re the
heart of the university. But I was invited to fraternities, and I very quickly
figured out why.
They were nervous I was going to admit just nerds, and where would
their fraternities be if the university was full of nerds. My response was,
“Look, why do you think being good at mathematics is mutually exclusive
from being the kind of person you want in your [fraternity]? You can be very
smart and [laughter] be interested in fraternal life.” I’m not sure that entirely
satisfied them. That was one element of apprehension on my part. The other
was there’s an annual event around Big Game time called Gaieties.
Traditionally, Fred Hargadon had taken part. He had a walk-on part in
Gaieties every year.
The first year in the job the students were very nice and said would I
join Gaieties. I said, you know, out of respect to Fred Hargadon, that was his
69

role and I wanted to relinquish it to my predecessor. A year went by and they
asked me again. They said he’s been gone a year, would you come. I said
Okay. I felt a little more comfortable. Okay, I’ll go. I think there were three
or four performances of Gaieties. I came on the stage and somebody, I think
in a slightly drunken state, shouted out from the audience, “Where’s Dean
Fred?” I had to make a split second decision, to retort or to just carry on as if
nothing had happened. I think I made the right decision. I just carried on as if
nothing happened.
[00:21:33] I walked off that stage that evening feeling as if someone had
put a knife through me. It was really almost a public humiliation. That was
tough. After three years or so, I was the dean, and he was gone to New York
and not quite forgotten, but I was established. But it was tough dealing with
that. As far as the faculty were concerned, I think I was uniformly welcomed.
It was wonderful. I mean it didn’t hurt that my husband was on the faculty,
so all his colleagues were happy.
Marine-Street: Before we leave Fred Hargadon, what was he like? Why was he a cult figure
do you think?
Chu: [00:22:37] First of all, his physical appearance. He must have been six-footfive, six-foot-four, six-foot-five. I think there are some studies about height
and effectiveness publicly. Your height immediately identifies you as a figure
of authority. He was totally, totally committed to the job. He claimed to have
read every application. Now, I know for a fact after a year on the job, it is
physically impossible to read every application. I was working ninety and a
hundred hours a week in the reading period. There is no way I could have
70

read every application. There was this myth that he had read the applications;
I mean I did read every admitted student, but I couldn’t have read all the
applications. There were these myths that were hard to dispel. He was a big
athletic fan. In fact, when he left the Stanford men’s crew named a boat after
him. So, yes. I think he did wonderful things for general student joie de vivre
and making them feel part of Stanford. But it was a hard act to follow.
Marine-Street: Did you continue participating in Gaieties after that first time?
Chu: [00:24:20] I did. I participated every year after that. It was a time-consuming
thing to do in November because I had to go to rehearsals.
Marine-Street: What kind of things would they have you do? I mean did you play yourself?
Chu: [00:24:33] Oh, no. You’ve been to Gaieties, right?
Marine-Street: I have not.
Chu: [00:24:37] Oh, you have not.
Marine-Street: I was a graduate student, not an undergrad. [laughter]
Chu: [00:24:39] Oh, okay. [laughter] I thought everybody had been to Gaieties.
They’re shows that are composed by Stanford students. One year I was
Glinda the Good. I rose up from the stage on a--it was a bit scary--on a
platform and waving my wand. Then these little gnomes came out and I said,
“What are your SAT scores?” [laughter] They built in funny things like that.
One year there was a rather wild bunch writing the script. They gave me the
script to prepare for rehearsal and I said, “Sorry, guys. I’m not going to say
that.” It was something really risqué. I can’t remember what it was. Anyway,
they laughed and said, “Oh, just testing the boundaries.”
Marine-Street: Oh, that’s funny.
71

Chu: [00:25:45] That was part of the job I had not prepared for. I think Fred, to his
credit, set the tone for the interaction of the dean of admissions at Stanford,
which is unlike any other university. They [the deans] were known by name
and welcomed. When I walked through commencement people cheered. It
was a little overwhelming.
Marine-Street: How did they start calling you Dean Jean?
Chu: [00:26:26] Fred was Dean Fred, and I think it was lucky for me that my name
actually rhymed with dean. That was very cute.
Marine-Street: Did Fred have any advice for you when you took over the job?
Chu: [00:26:40] The short answer--no. I think he just thought I should find my
own way. I was lucky that I inherited John Bunnell who’d been his associate
dean for almost all his tenure. John was incredibly experienced and was a very
helpful guide to me. The first year I just decided I would inherit everything as
I’d received it and follow the procedures they had. Then I started getting a
little bolder and introducing changes to the process, like involving the math
faculty which was unheard of.
The other thing I did was I asked ten emeriti faculty if they would help us
read some applications. But they found it so difficult to do. I’m quoting
statistics from my tenure as dean. When you have 4,500 students with straight
A transcripts, and you gave 100 of them at random to faculty, they all look
good.
Marine-Street: Set the stage for me a little bit. You’ve gotten this job. Where’s the office
located? Tell me a little bit about the facilities. Then walk me through the
process of it, how admissions worked when you took the job.
72

Chu: [00:28:13] Okay. We occupied half of the floor of the Old Union. I mean it’s
now in a completely different building. The biggest part of the space was
where all the files were located. In 1985 we had about seventeen thousand
applications. The [administrative staff] were all women who were amazing.
Three or four of them were Filipinos. Incredibly reliable hard-working
people. Their job was to manually assemble each application file. You can
imagine all these pieces of paper flying in from all over the world, not just
from the United States. I’m going to sidetrack myself in this answer for a
minute. These were called the “creds” people, the credentials people.
One of the things I did in my first couple of months in the job, I role
played everybody’s job to see what they had to do and how it could be
improved. These four Filipino women were quite small, and their jobs in
assembling the files involved pushing these incredibly heavy tubs of files
around this large room and assembling them. I said, “We have to find a better
way to do it.” We put a lot of money into getting files that could be
electrically operated so that they had to just stand in front of a file and
assemble the whole tub of rolling files. The files of individual applicants were
filed alphabetically in these electrically operated containers, and every
reference (or other relevant) letter needed to be added to each student’s
application; this involved a lot of paper movement and essential accuracy in
assembling each file. That was the credentials part of it. Then there were
about twelve people who were assistant directors of admission. Their job in
the fall quarter was to go and visit high schools and talk about Stanford,

73

explain the application process, and so on. We also held information sessions
daily in the Old Union for visiting students and their parents.
Then between January and April--that was the toughest part of the year-the non-credential staff devoted their whole time to reading, all day every
day. It requires amazing discipline and concentration. My mother lived in
London and I was always terrified that my mother was going to get sick in the
reading period. Thank goodness, in seven years in the job she didn’t. Your
personal life is annihilated. Fred had been adamant that all the reading was to
be done in the twelve offices. No file was to leave the building. I said this is
senseless. If you want to work at home, you check the files out, you take
them home, and you bring them back in and you check them back in the next
day.
I think that made people’s lives much easier because they could work at
home where they could be in their sweat suits. They didn’t have to dress up
to come in the office. They could eat and drink whenever they wanted. I
think that was a much appreciated change in the office. The other significant
change I introduced, not in the first year because I didn’t know enough.
Students were asked to submit a small photo of themselves. You can’t help
but be affected by seeing a photo of someone. I think the tipping point for
me when I raised this question was a young man who’d been in a terrible car
accident and was totally disfigured. He’d been burned. You know, you
couldn’t help but feel compassion. It’s bound to affect your judgment.
[00:32:26] There were other examples. You know, women posing in
seductive bikinis. There was one young man from New York [laughter] who
74

submitted a photo of himself in the nude throwing a discus. [laughter] You
know, I think he thought it was funny. He was a very muscularly built young
Olympian, but--. I had this argument with my two associate deans. They
thought it was inappropriate and therefore he should not be admitted. I said,
“Come on, guys. He’s a brilliant kid. It’s his sense of humor.” Anyway, we
compromised. He was wait-listed and he went to Harvard. There you have it.
So then I raised the question, “Why are we asking for photos?” I
inherited a staff and they were all used to photos. They didn’t see anything
wrong. There were a couple who thought it was questionable. I said I’m going
to ask someone in Psychology. I found wonderful Al Hastorf [Albert
Hastorf] who went on to be provost.
I said, “Al, has there ever been any research done on the effect of
appearance, i.e. in a photo, and judgment?”
He said, “Yes.” He answered immediately. “Yes. It can be summarized
in three words. Beautiful is good.”
I said, “Okay. You just confirmed what I thought. No more
photographs for Stanford.”
Marine-Street: Interesting.
Chu: [00:34:02] Yes. It was interesting. It took a little courage on my part to have
gone through the process that I inherited and then to tweak it and make some
changes. The more significant changes were the math and art, music, drama
and dance. The photo was symbolic for me.
Marine-Street: Were any aspects of the process computerized at that time?

75

Chu: [00:34:29] They hadn’t been, but I pushed to get it done. In the credentials
area they would get sticky labels from the College Board with people’s SAT
scores. The labels had to be peeled off and put in the right file. I said there
must be a better way to do this. I think this was the beginning of computing
in the admissions process. We got a computer-generated list of our applicants
and the SATs on it and the files were automatically merged. That made the
process a little easier for the credentials people.
Marine-Street: Was there any kind of computer technology at all in the office in terms of
when you were sorting ratings, or just keeping track of how many
applications?
Chu: [00:35:23] Yes. There was data entry. For example, at the end of the process I
could ask for a computer printout of all the high schools in the pool and
who’d applied from each high school and which ones we’d admitted. But
then you had to plow through a foot high of computer output. How they
manage it today with 43,000 applications is mindboggling to me.
Marine-Street: Hopefully some of it is more automated.
Chu: [00:36:03] Oh, yes. All the applications process now is online. One of my
assistant deans went on to be dean of admission at Johns Hopkins. I went to
visit him when I was living in D.C. I said, “Show me, John, how you read
files.” It was on a computer screen. I said, “Gosh. You know, I like to have a
pencil and my pen in my hand and scribble on our internal application form.”
Marine-Street: Walk me through how you would go about reading an application.
Chu: [00:36:39] Okay. The credentials people assemble all the material, which is an
information sheet with basic stuff--address, family who’d attended Stanford,
76

that kind of thing. Then the next would be the student’s personal part of the
application. Then the guidance counselor’s report, plus the two teacher
references. Then any supplementary material. There was this file of maybe ten
or twelve pieces of paper. At the front of it we had our own work card. It was
a yellow card. John Bunnell, as the director of freshman admissions, would
distribute twenty-five--I think it was twenty-five--files a day to read to the
assistant directors and they would go through the file. They had columns on
the worksheet where they made comments. First of all they had to
recommend an academic rating and a nonacademic rating, the one-to-five
scale I told you about. Then they also had to recommend Admit, Deny, or
what we called Swim. They were given a quota as the first reader of a file of
how many you could admit--it was like 20 percent--to cut down the pool.
Then the process was repeated by a second reader.
Marine-Street: The same applications.
Chu: [00:38:18] The same applications. The second reader had the benefit of seeing
the first reader’s comments. Then I and John Bunnell and my other
wonderful associate dean, Parker Beverage, who went on to be dean of
admissions at Colby, the three of us were the third readers on every file.
(Parker was later replaced by Bill Tingley, sadly now deceased.) We assessed
the first two reader’s comments, added our own comments, and we made the
final call on Admit, Deny, or Swim. We also made the final call on the
academic and the nonacademic rating. The Admits were relatively
straightforward. Not always. The Denies were relatively straightforward. It

77

was the set in the middle, the Swims, that went back for a fourth and a fifth
reading.
Then we had to decide. By then we knew how many we’d admitted.
Our goal was, as I remember, 2,500 to admit by April 1, and we added those
Swims. They were either admitted, denied or wait-listed. There were a couple
of hundred put on the wait list each year.
Marine-Street: What kind of things would you write on the card?
Chu: [00:39:50] You’d make some comment on academic credentials saying
“Hasn’t taken any AP classes, although ten are offered in his high school.”
There was one kid [laughter] who was top of his graduating class from a small
school in Colorado. He was the valedictorian but there were only two in his
class. [laughter] We’d say something like “Misleading to be called
valedictorian in a class of two.” Some academic comment. And then a
summary of the references. We’d say things like “Guidance counselor clearly
doesn’t know her.” This is a comment from a guidance counselor about an
applicant that I will take to my grave. “His forehead has been touched by the
finger of God.” You’d say something like, “How about that for praise?”
Then you’d make a summary record of why you were recommending
Admit, Deny, or Swim. I think the process is quite different now. I think they
read by high school. We didn’t read by high school, we read by individual.
Marine-Street: Talk about that a little bit. How familiar were you with the types of high
schools or the specific high schools that the applicants were coming from?
Chu: [00:41:36] At Stanford, the two high schools in California are Palo Alto High
School and Gunn. They’re local. Many of them have Stanford faculty
78

connections or Stanford staff connection, and they wanted to come to
Stanford. Or conversely [laughter], therefore, they wanted to get away from
Stanford. In the computer printout, I did quite a lot of studying of data. I
wanted to know which were the biggest feeder schools. There are 26,000 high
schools in the United States. You can’t know every one. I would say probably
the top fifty, or hundred, you knew these produced good kids for Stanford.
All the East Coast private schools--Andover, Exeter, and St. Paul’s, Groton-these very distinguished elite private schools. These were toughies in that
how do you weigh that against a kid who comes from a rural high school
from non-college educated parents.
Yes, you have to have background information as a context. Judgment
calls come into play in a subjective admissions process. It’s very different
from, for example, the UC system. If you get certain SAT scores, certain
grades, and the required courses and you’re in the top--what it is, I don’t
know today--12 percent of your graduating class, you know you’re going to
get admitted to the UC system. There’s no predictability in the Stanford
process, and it’s been criticized for that, although I think it’s very rare that a
high school guidance counselor would say, “Why did you admit him?” They
know. Or, “Why did you admit her?”
Marine-Street: Did you have any kind of firm cutoffs for GPAs or SAT scores that you
wouldn’t even consider if they were below a certain [score]?
Chu: [00:44:00] Not firm cutoffs, but there were probabilities. And truth in
advertising--again, I don’t know if it’s still done--we used to publish an
academic profile of applicants, admits, and enrolling students by SAT scores
79

and high school GPA. High school GPA can be very misleading. For an
example, some schools don’t give grades so you don’t have a GPA to go on.
Some high schools don’t rank students. You could see that the higher your
SAT score, the higher the probability of admission. I once was talking to an
alumni group and one person said, “How come you admitted this student
with 500 verbal scores?”
I said, “Let me give you an example of somebody who may score 500
on the verbal. A Korean student whose father is in the diplomatic corps who
moved to Amsterdam, has lived in Paris, Berlin, and Brussels, and is
quadrilingual, and takes the SAT. I wouldn’t do very well in those
circumstances.” But he was a fascinating student. You know, that’s the
wonderful thing about the subjective process. The subjective process allows
subjectivity, but it’s much harder to defend than the UC system.
Marine-Street: Were there certain metrics that you paid attention to? Kind of macro level
metrics that you worried about as the dean of admissions?
Chu: [00:45:46] This is going to segue into athletics. I’ll let you tell me when you
want to move on to that subject.
Marine-Street: Okay.
Chu: [00:45:55] No. I mean one of the advantages of--to use the example I used
before-- having portfolios in art, music, drama, and dance [is that] you
attracted certain students in those disciplines. That contributes to the overall
class at Stanford. I was just reading in today’s Stanford Report, and I could only
think with sorrow of a typical Stanford undergraduate. A young man, twentythree year old co-terminal student. It said he died in a running accident. Then
80

it went on to give his credentials, that he was a scholar at his high school and
played piano, all-state jazz bands--you know, these incredible talents come
nationwide. Stanford is very fortunate in attracting such an incredible pool of
people.
Marine-Street: How did you know how many students you were allowed to admit?
Chu: [00:47:05] Again, data analysis. [laughter] I looked at previous years, what are
called yield rates. That’s the percentage of students who accept over those
who were admitted. In my time, it never got above 62 percent. I’m amazed.
The only person who beat us was Harvard. It was in the 70, 72 percent range.
Of course, very good kids get admitted to five or six schools and they can
only choose one. That affects everybody’s yield rate. Now they have the early
decision process at Stanford and that ties in much more of the class. How did
you know how many to admit? You knew what the previous year’s yield rate
was and you started with that number in mind to produce a freshman class of
1,600 students.
The one year that went astray was 1989 when the Loma Prieta
earthquake hit Stanford. I think understandably, many students and their
parents didn’t want their kids going to an “earthquake school.” So the yield
dropped by 2 percent that year.
Marine-Street: Hmmm. That’s a pretty significant number.
Chu: [00:48:27] Yes. But it went up [laughter] the following year.
Marine-Street: Memories are short.
Chu: [00:48:33] Yes. Now I think Stanford surpasses everyone in yield rate.
Marine-Street: Yield rate was something that you worried about?
81

Chu: [00:48:46] Oh, yes. Absolutely. In fact, I used to joke with students when I
would visit high schools and they would talk about the anxiety of the process.
I said, “Well, look. You have to look at it this way. Between January 1 and
April 1, you’re the ones worried. Between April 1st and May 1st, we’re the ones
who are worried. We’re offering you admission, but will you come?” That
was another thing I introduced at Stanford. Fred Hargadon did not, for
reasons that I don’t understand, want to have students visiting campus in any
organized fashion between the time they were admitted and the time they had
to send in their decision letter.
We introduced ProFro Weekend. Thousands of people come now. It’s
the students and their parents. I think it’s wonderful. It’s a way of giving them
exposure to the institution. They can talk to students. I think one of the
reasons I heard Fred didn’t like it was, you know, you get into a dorm and
you talk to some student and you don’t hit it off. That affects your decision;
therefore, you don’t come to Stanford.
Marine-Street: Talk a little bit more about that. What made you decide to do that? Were
other colleges doing it?
Chu: [00:50:18] I think it’s become much more frequent now that everybody has
these organized college visitation weekends. The problem is you have like a
four-week window to do it. Some of the prospective freshman weekends-they’re mainly always on a weekend to avoid conflicts with school and if
parents want to travel. If they do it together then students have to choose—
”Do I go to Princeton or do I go to Harvard? How do I organize my time?”
I’m all for truth in advertising. You know, let people come and explore and
82

sit in on lectures and meet with other students. Stanford is such a physically
enticing place that I think we have [laughter] a huge advantage.
Marine-Street: Do you have any memories of how the first weekend went? Any memories of
what you had planned or how it went off?
Chu: [00:51:19] It was a little overwhelming because it was the first time and we
didn’t know how many people would come and we didn’t know how to
organize it. It was a learning process. You know, where were students to be
housed? They were encouraged to bring sleeping bags and sleep on dorm
floors. Then you have things you never thought about--what happens if they
get their first taste of alcohol in the dorm, or the moral responsibility of this
organizing group, or your first sexual experience when you’re on a ProFro
Weekend. It’s not something you encourage but you have to anticipate that
there will be incidents.
Marine-Street: How did you plan for those?
Chu: [00:52:18] [laughter] I think the first time we didn’t think of any of these. Or
we thought of few of them, but it was not very well organized. I don’t
remember how many students came. One very energetic member of my staff,
who was himself a Stanford graduate, was in charge of the ProFro Weekend,
as we called it. Then it grew like Topsy. It was great to see it. We got better at
doing it. Now it’s incredibly highly organized.
Marine-Street: Yes. Let’s take a break.
Chu: [00:52:52] Okay.

INTERVIEWEE:

JEAN H. CHU, INTERVIEW 2 (part 2 of 2)

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

AUGUST 30, 2016

Marine-Street:

You had mentioned some of the ways you evaluated applications on
academic quality and extracurriculars. What did you do about character issues
or personal qualities?

Chu:

[00:00:38] Of course, that’s a very important thing for consideration. I didn’t
mention it immediately with academic and nonacademic evaluation because
those are much more easily put on a scale of one to five. Personal qualities
are very tough to get at and you rely on the teacher references and the
guidance counselor report and in some cases, what the student reveals in his
or her application. We did discuss whether we could try to evaluate a person’s
qualities on some numerical scale to help us keep better track, but it’s almost
impossible to do. [laughter] For example, I remember one applicant admitted
to being an admirer of Adolf Hitler. Now, that’s not an academic or a
nonacademic criterion fit, but it says something about personal qualities.
There was an interesting experiment which is relevant to that subject. I
used to have frequent conversations with the dean of students who was then
Jim Lyons [James W. Lyons]. Jim was the person who saw all the honor code
violations, plagiarism, incidents in the dorms in some way. One day, for
85

example, he said, “Okay, Fetter…” as he called me, “How come you
admitted someone who urinates in a bowl of carrots?” Apparently this is what
a student did. Anyway, after Jim’s goading me for a long time, I said, “Jim,
let’s do an experiment. We’ll have a retreat with your staff and my staff. You
pick out six baddies and six goodies from a particular year. I’ll pull out their
applications. We’ll blank out all the names and other personal identification.
Your staff will read them all and say which are the goodies and which are the
baddies. And my staff will do the same.” We concluded there was no way you
could predict.
For example, there was one where the high school guidance counselor
said, “Future state senator.” [laughter] [That student had committed] double
plagiarism. Anyway, that made Jim and his staff a little more sympathetic to
the job we designed, but it also gives you a sense of the challenge of assessing
the qualities that are going to lead [to success]? How do you measure success?
Success is measured in very different ways. Academic success is pretty
straightforward, but--.
Marine-Street:

One of the things I’ve always wondered is why Stanford doesn’t admit people
to a specific program, the Engineering School, for example.

Chu:

[00:04:09] Yes. I’m actually in favor of that [Stanford’s system] having gone to
a university where I knew I was going to major in physics. Some schools, for
example UC Berkeley, admit to the School of Engineering. I’m a firm believer
that an eighteen year old does not know whether engineering is his or her
destiny. I saw a number of cases at Stanford in my own freshman advisees-the ones who were quickest to declare a major in the first quarter of their
86

freshman year were the ones who most quickly changed it. [laughter] The
opportunity for choice I think is wonderful.
Marine-Street:

Was that a value that was strongly articulated to you when you took the
position in terms of this is the way that we do it at Stanford? We don’t admit
to specific departments?

Chu:

[00:05:14] It was a given. I don’t know who articulated it. One [laughter] of
the interesting things that arose in my interview for dean of admissions was
that I went in with a guidebook. It was called the Committee on
Undergraduate Admission and Financial Aid. It was a committee of the
faculty senate. There was one clause which said, “The dean of admissions has
the authority on all admits with the exception of those made by the
president.” When I went [laughter] to my interview I said, “Well, what are
these exceptions made by the president?” The faculty were totally
dumbfounded. They’d never heard of it either. Anyway, I said, “Well, I don’t
want to be taking a job under those circumstances.” After I was in the
position the faculty senate voted to amend that [clause] and the president is
no longer in it.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

There’s a historical reason for that language which we’ll have to uncover.
[00:06:28] Yes. Yes. I’m sure there’s a historical reason. In fact, my
counterpart--I won’t name the Ivy League school--asked me, “Would the
president of Stanford ever admit a basketball player?”
I said, “Absolutely not. That’s my domain and I would resent any
intrusion.”

87

He said he’d been away from campus and in his absence his president had
admitted a basketball player.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Interesting.
[00:07:03] I think that’s probably the historical precedent at Stanford when, in
those days, that was how it was done.

Marine-Street:

You mean the president’s office never called you up and said, “Oh, could you
pay special attention to this file?”

Chu:

[00:07:21] There was one occasion where I received a letter from Don
Kennedy [Donald Kennedy] about an applicant. I won’t go into the details. I
called Don and said, “Don, you know if I put this letter in that student’s file,
the first and the second reader are going to be so influenced by having a letter
from you in there that they’re going to feel obliged to recommend admit.” I
said, “What I’ll do is keep the letter in my drawer and I’ll use it at my
discretion.” It turned out the kid was admitted anyway so it was moot.
[laughter] Don was wonderful. He was very understanding. I think he’d been
under some pressure to send me a note. That was the one and only instance I
remember. I was totally independent. It was a really wonderful system.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

That’s amazing.
[00:08:19] It means that when the president gets letters complaining about
admissions decisions, the president can rightfully say “This person doesn’t
report to me. This is not my jurisdiction. The decisions are made by the dean
of admissions.” I reported to the provost.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

You reported to the provost hierarchically.
[00:08:53] To the provost. Yes.
88

Marine-Street:

What kind of goals or visions did they have for you, or were you more
independent?

Chu:

[00:09:03] It was very interesting. There was little interference from the
Committee on Undergraduate Admission and Financial Aid. These were all
faculty members and they weren’t intimately involved in the process,
therefore, they were really strongly influenced by what I and the director of
financial aid, Bob Huff [Robert P. Huff], would say to them. They didn’t
interfere.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Sounds like you had quite a lot of power.
[00:09:42] I didn’t look at it that way. I don’t like to look at it that way
[laugher] because, you know, I was responsible to people.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

But a lot of authority. I mean a lot of independent authority.
[00:09:54] I had a lot of authority. Yes. Yes.
All right. You’ve gone through all of this rigmarole about figuring out who
you’re going to admit. Tell me a little bit about sending out the letters and
what that time of year was like.

Chu:

[00:10:09] Totally overwhelming. First of all, I was physically and emotionally
drained after twelve weeks of reading files. Then I decided I wanted to
personally sign every admit letter. That was 2,600 admit letters. Since I played
tennis, I wore my tennis elbow thing for protection because I would sign my
name and then I’d say something personal, like, “Natalie, terrific.” I had a
number of adjectives. “Natalie, great” or “Natalie, excellent.” Some students
told me afterwards they’d get the letter and go like this [makes a rubbing
gesture to see if it was really ink] to make sure it wasn’t laser printed.
89

[laughter] “Did she really sign it?” Yes, I really signed it. One year I was so
amused--I got a telephone call from a student saying, “Thank you, Dean
Fetter, for admitting me. I had a question. At the bottom of my letter you
said, ‘Thomas, terrific.’ What does that exactly refer to?” [laughter]
I said, “Well, Thomas, you know, generically terrific.” [laughter]
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Oh, funny.
[00:11:32] It’s funny how people take it literally. That was one challenge.
After being physically and mentally exhausted, I had to go through this
physical act of signing the letters. Then there was this great ceremony of
delivering them to the post office. Then two days later, the fallout. I got calls
from guidance counselors, principals, parents, alumni, faculty. One of the
most memorable was [when] my secretary came into my office and said,
“Mrs. T”-- I remember the name--”is there outside in the lobby with her
daughter who was not admitted and she refuses to leave until you meet with
her.” I said, “Well, better get it over and done with.”
She came in and I had Jacqueline (I’ll call her), the daughter’s file in
front of me, and of course, the mother wanted gory blow-by-blow detail of
why she wasn’t admitted. The poor kid was sitting there. There were certain
things I couldn’t reveal. I mean she had an excellent academic record, but
there were certain things in the reference letters that I could not reveal, so I
had to dance around it. The best way to deal with it is to try and put it in
context and say, “Look, we had 17,000 applications and 4,500 straight A
students. You were good. But in that field, there was nothing you could do
about the competition.” Anyway, the mother stormed out. She said, “She’s
90

going to Berkeley and she’ll apply for transfer admission,” which is exactly
what she did and she was admitted.
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

She was?
[00:13:29] Yes.
Oh, interesting.
[00:13:31] I haven’t talked about transfer admissions. Let’s see. When was the
deadline? I think March, April. It was soon after the freshman decisions. We
got about twelve hundred transfer applicants. Many of them had applied as
freshmen, so we kept the files. I had the benefit of a transfer file and a
freshman application file. That mother-daughter visit was one kind of fallout.
Then [there were] guidance counselors. I was visiting a friend in
Minnesota and we were in an art museum sitting down having lunch. This
was after the admissions process was over. I was sitting there having lunch
and a woman [who was a guidance counselor] came tearing up to me and
said. “How dare you not admit--” and she reeled off the name of the student.
“I’ll never trust the Stanford admissions process again.” [laughter] My friend
was absolutely dumbstruck. I said [laughter], “You never know where you’re
going to be, sitting in an art museum having lunch--.”

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Oh, my goodness.
[00:14:51] The toughies were faculty. There are a couple of Stanford faculty
who will never speak to me again for not admitting their kids.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

What was your strategy for dealing with all of these unhappy people?
[00:15:09] Try and do your best to explain. You know, there’s a limit to how
effective that can be. It’s a painful process for a parent to go through. In
91

many cases, [it’s] the first time the son or daughter has [not] been rewarded.
The other thing I tried to do was to help them put it in perspective. I’d say,
where has he/she been admitted, and it’s a wonderful school, and it may turn
out to be a much better match. Stanford is not for everyone. This is a large
research university, but again, it falls on deaf ears for the most part. All you
can do is your best.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did you ever reverse a decision?
[00:16:04] Only a reverse from accepting to not accepting. This was an
interesting case. After the admissions letters went out and people had
accepted, they were contacted by various groups, clubs on campus who
thought they would be interested in joining. This young man--I think he
wrote a letter--said, “Why am I getting all this literature from the Black
Student Union?”
I had his file in front of me. There was certainly one phone call that
took place. I don’t remember the order of events. I said, “Well, because you
self-identified as African-American.”
He said, “You mean, I was only admitted”--I mean this was sort of
blackmailing--”I was only admitted because I was African-American?”
I said, “No. You self-identified as African-American.”
He said, “Well, I’m not.”
I said, “Well, that’s misrepresentation and that is grounds for
withdrawal of your application.”
I looked into it further and he’d misrepresented himself on taking the
SATs, too. He claimed he was African-American and he was actually a
92

Caucasian student. We withdrew his offer of admission. Then I had a moral
dilemma, should I let my colleagues at other institutions know. I don’t
remember what I did with that one. There are all these terrible moral
dilemmas that came up.
Marine-Street:

I was wondering when you had all these moral dilemmas it seems like they
would just keep you up at night.

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:17:59] Yes.
How did you deal with this kind of pressure and what grounded you?
[00:18:03] That’s a very good question. It reminds me of something that
sustained me through this job. Sandra Day O’Connor was a Stanford law
graduate and in fact, a Stanford undergraduate, and then, of course, she went
to serve on the Supreme Court. I read an interview of hers one day.
Somebody asked her “How can you manage to go to sleep at night [when]
you have to make all these terrible decisions?”
She said, “You make the best decision you can and you move on.”
Otherwise you would become dysfunctional. You know, the best decision
you can. You can’t always claim it was right--whatever right means, whatever
right is. [laughter]

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did the fervor die down relatively quickly after the letters went out?
[00:19:01] It was probably a good month. Then [there were the] instances
after the event, like being in that art gallery in Minneapolis or wherever it was.
It was Minneapolis, I think. That guidance counselor attack came out of the
blue. [laughter]

93

Marine-Street:

I know you must have had a lot of correspondence from disappointed people
as well, and some of it not very nice. Did you answer every letter?

Chu:
Marine-Street:

[00:19:34] I tried to.
Did you ever just think, “Why am I answering all these nasty letters? Do I
owe these people an explanation?”

Chu:

[00:19:43] I think it was for me a matter of principle. You know, we did the
best we could. They were very, very difficult decision to make, and you try
and help people see what the circumstances are. Some heart-rending cases.
There was more than one case of a student we admitted with a terminal
illness. Really tragic. Tragic circumstances.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Would you talk as a team when you made the decisions?
[00:20:33] I only remember one where I would do the process differently,
although I don’t know how I’d handle it with 44,000 applications. I think
there is some benefit of a team approach. But ultimately the responsibility
was mine and I thought I had to make the decision. I was the one who signed
the letters. I didn’t sign all the denial letters.

Marine-Street:

How did it work? You’re evaluating people on their individual qualities and
their grades--what kind of attention was given to what the whole body of a
class looked like? How did you manage that?

Chu:

[00:21:28] One thing I did have a horror of--what if we admitted only white
males who wanted to major in engineering? Fortunately it never worked out
that way. I was very happily surprised. Without any social engineering of any
kind, the class turned out to be almost half and half men and women. Yes. I

94

think it’s now slightly more women than men, but I don’t keep up with the
data on those fronts anymore.
Marine-Street:

What about, “Oh, we haven’t admitted anybody who’s interested in dance
this year, or anybody who’s interested in psychology?”

Chu:

[00:22:18] No. I mean we’re going to talk about athletics in depth. That’s the
only situation. Apart from--as I mentioned earlier--the math, music, art,
drama, and dance. The other thing I haven’t mentioned in terms of diversity
is that Stanford is truly a need-blind admissions process. We’re fortunate in
being an institution that is so well endowed that it can genuinely afford to
make decisions need-blind. I don’t know if it’s changed.
When I had a conversation with the current dean about eighteen month
ago, it hadn’t changed. The only exception to that rule was international
students. The director of financial aid was given a pot of money--I think it
was $400,000--for international students, because if you admit one
impoverished student from--let me choose a country--Pakistan--you could
almost wipe yourself out. Two, three impoverished students from Pakistan.
We admitted the students and then the names were handed to Bob Huff, who
was then director of financial aid. I was very happy that we were two separate
offices because I could genuinely say [when asked about aid] “I don’t know
anything about the details of the financial aid package.” Of course you could
guess if both parents were MDs or both parents were venture capitalists-that’s an unlikely scenario--but [laughter] that they wouldn’t need much
financial aid. Of course, as you well know, socioeconomic status is correlated
with academic achievement, particularly SAT scores.
95

Marine-Street:
Chu:

No kind of master social plan that you had?
[00:24:37] No. No. Now, in terms of diversity, we made every effort to seek
out the best minority students nationwide. There were three targeted groups,
Native-Americans, which was the toughest because it’s such a small set,
African-Americans, and Mexican-Americans. There was one undergraduate
who argued with me till I was blue in the face trying to give counterarguments as to why Native-Hawaiian students were not a targeted group
because he was Native-Hawaiian. Then you could argue why AsianAmericans in general aren’t a special targeted group. This latter presented a
fascinating case.
My second year the allegation was made by a Stanford undergraduate
that Stanford had an upper limit on the number of Asian-Americans admitted
to the freshman class. He had statistics that were compelling. It was 7
percent. I said, “Jeff (the name of the student), that’s a very serious allegation.
We will look into it.” The provost appointed a faculty committee to review
any bias in the admissions process against Asian-Americans, chaired by
Professor Jeff Wine. It turned out there were two factors that played a role.
Number one, athletics. In those days, very few Asian-Americans were
recruited athletes. It’s changed. [laughter] Second was the alumni legacy tip.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Oh, interesting.
[00:26:34] Since there had been very few Asian-Americans, there were very
few legacies. Jeff Wine, the faculty member in Psychology who chaired this
committee said, “Jean, even before we give you the results of our
investigation, I can tell you the fact that we’re looking into it is going to
96

influence this year’s class because your unconscious bias will be conscious.”
When I started as dean in 1984, the freshman class was 7 percent AsianAmerican. When I left it was 24 percent.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

That’s a big difference.
[00:27:17] Harvard and I think Princeton are currently undergoing
investigations for exactly the same charge. This is a terrible generalization, but
in this case I think it’s true. Since I’m married to an Asian-American now I
can say that the role of education in Asian-American families is so dominant
that these kids are often among the very best applicants academically. I
remember visiting high schools in Southern California. I think I visited eight
high schools in three days. Every valedictorian was Asian-American.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

Interesting.
[00:28:04] Yes. Fascinating.
What do you think changed during those years as a result of the investigation?
Did you make any conscious changes to your policy?

Chu:

[00:28:13] We brought in a faculty member--I think it varied from year to year
which department they came in from--to talk to us about unconscious bias. It
was a generic thing. My bias was against cheerleaders. Right? [laughter] I grew
up in England and there wasn’t such a thing as cheerleaders and I couldn’t
imagine that a cheerleader would ever get a PhD in nuclear physics, for
example. I mean it’s an absolutely ridiculous kind of bias. Everybody has
some. And it goes back to the use of photographs. When you see a
photograph of somebody, like it or not, you have some bias about it. What
did we do about the three groups that we targeted? There were three assistant
97

deans, each of those ethnicities, and we used every means possible to attract
the best students from those cultures.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Can you give me some examples of what kind of things you would do?
[00:29:35] From the College Board, which does the standardized testing, you
can purchase minority lists, so we would request lists with scores above 600. I
don’t remember what the cutoff was. Then we would write individual letters
to each of those students. I had a very painful example of a challenge in this
scenario. The wonderful first Mexican-American dean I hired, Chris Ponce, I
promoted to be the sort of general manager of the office, you know, all the
things that you need in an office--HR and payroll, that kind of stuff. That left
me without the Mexican- American who was responsible for recruitment and
attraction efforts.
I had a little search committee, and I was not happy with the candidates
they presented and I didn’t immediately make an appointment. You’d have
thought hell had broken loose. I was summoned before the MexicanAmerican community to meet in El Centro Chicano, which was their central
office space in the Old Union. It was horrible. It was a night meeting and the
room was packed. There must have been 150 people there. You’d think that I
hadn’t shown any interest, any effort. I felt as if the whole universe in that
room was against me. I tried to defend myself and said, you know, “Look.
The results speak for themselves. Look at the people we have at Stanford
now as a consequence of these efforts.” Anyway, I said, “I’m not willing to
hire somebody that I don’t think can do the job well.” That was my defense,

98

which I thought was a reasonable defense. They felt they didn’t have anybody
to represent them in admissions.
Marine-Street:

It was important that the person actually be Mexican-American themselves?

Chu:

[00:31:52] I think so. Yes. I think to the Mexican-American community that
was very important. I said, “Look, I seek your help. Help me find
somebody.” Anyway, we did eventually appoint somebody and the furor died
down.

Marine-Street:

You would purchase these lists and send letters. Did the assistant deans go
and visit students as well?

Chu:

[00:32:14] They visited, yes. They had responsibility for coordinating efforts. I
tried to visit maybe fifty schools a year myself. I mean these visitations are
very time-consuming. You have to fly to Place X, rent a car, find your way
around to four different high schools. Anyway, I was visiting a high school in
Forth Worth, Texas. The guidance counselor said, “You know, I’m amazed
your football coaches haven’t gone after Tom,” and he gave me the guy’s
name. A young African-American. He said, “He’s very smart. He’s a great
football player. He’d be a great catch.” I came back and gave the name to one
of the coaches, and lo and behold, he was admitted to Stanford. We all tried
to contribute in different ways.

Marine-Street:

What kind of directives did the university have for you in terms of diversity? I
know there was a big increase during the time that you were dean in the
percentage of [minority] students.

Chu:

[00:33:35] Again, the guidelines for the dean of admissions are set by the
Committee on Undergraduate Admission and Financial Aid. They were the
99

ones, for example, who determined that there should be a cap on the amount
of financial aid given to international students. They also determined the
targeted groups.
Marine-Street:

How frequent was your interaction with that committee? How did that
interaction occur?

Chu:

[00:34:05] We met maybe once a month. You know, any big committee
assignment for a faculty member, you have to be extraordinarily devoted to
really dig in the trenches [laughter] with the troops because they have their
own job. What it usually amounted to is me making some presentation, Bob
Huff making some presentation, and them asking some questions. Every year
I gave a report to the Faculty Senate, and every year I gave a report to the
Board of Trustees. That kept me on my toes.

Marine-Street:

Were there certain things that they were very interested in, those different
bodies?

Chu:

[00:34:54] Trustees were interested in yield rate. Why wasn’t the yield rate
higher? [laughter] I had a ready answer for that. I said, “You know, I could
make the yield rate 100 percent, but the faculty just would not like the class
we admitted.” There are tradeoffs here. You want to admit the very best
students, and the very best students are going to have lots of offers.

Marine-Street:

Was there a small group of colleges that were the main benchmarks that you
measured yourself against?

Chu:

[00:35:32] Oh, yes. Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. MIT. We all got to know
each other very well. I’m amazed. Bill Fitzsimmons [William Fitzsimmons],
who was the dean at Harvard when I was dean at Stanford is still in the job.
100

He was an ice hockey player at Harvard. We all were very good friends. I
mean it was friendly competition. My counterpart at MIT, we laughed every
year because we were big competitors for the Asian-American applicants. We
garnered the biggest set of Asian-Americans, MIT and Stanford, because they
were often prospective science and engineering majors.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did Stanford’s process differ a lot from those other schools?
[00:36:27] I think it did when I was dean in the way we read. They read by
committee and they used alumni in the process, and Stanford didn’t. It does
now I think. You know, Rick Shaw [Richard Shaw], who’s the current dean,
was the dean at Yale. When I first knew him he was an assistant dean at UC
Berkeley. Then he migrated eastward and went to Yale and then came back to
Stanford. I think people bring what they think works best.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

What do you mean they read by committee?
[00:37:14] They read by region. There would be one director in the office
who was responsible for Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island. I don’t
know what their geographical distribution was. There was a group that read
all the applicants from that school or from that area, and then they were all
filtered--I don’t know how they did it--each area was prorated on how many
kids they could admit. Then that was all fed to the dean.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

They were similar in terms of the kind of criteria?
[00:37:51] Oh, yes. There are interesting games [laughter] places play. I met a
young woman a couple of years ago who was admitted to Stanford and I said-we knew her through a personal friend--”So where else did you apply?” She
was interested in Duke, but she didn’t get admitted. She was wait-listed at
101

Duke. I was stunned. I thought, she was admitted to Stanford and she was
wait-listed at Duke? Stanford, in general, was more competitive than Duke.
I said, “Hmmm. I’m surprised at that.”
She said, “Oh, I think I know why it happened.” Someone from Duke
called. She was in a private school in New England. “Someone called my
guidance counselor and asked, ‘What was my first choice?’”
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Oh, interesting.
[00:38:58] And the caller was told that her first choice--I mean this is verging
on unethical behavior to my mind--the guidance counselor said her first
choice was Stanford. Duke knew they would lose her to Stanford so they
don’t admit. You know, they’re worried about their yield rate because the
yield rate is also factored in U.S. News & World Report rankings of colleges.

Marine-Street:

I always wondered if as you were reading you were saying, “Oh, no, this one
sounds like a Yale student—”

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:39:33] [laughter] Absolutely not.
“--this one’s a sure Harvard one.”
[00:39:35] Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Let me speak for myself. I can’t get
in the minds of all the other people who read files when I was dean.

Marine-Street:

Let’s see. I wanted to ask you just a little bit about the number of
applications. It strikes me that your students get better if you have more
students to pick from. What kind of efforts were there to in general increase
the number of applications, or was that something that you were kind of
trying consciously to do?

102

Chu:

[00:40:26] Certainly not consciously increase the applicant pool. I think it’s
Stanford’s reputation, in general, that has increased the applicant pool even if
the admissions people never set foot off Stanford campus. The fact that there
are so many Nobel Prizes at Stanford, the athletic teams always win the
Directors Cup, we had thirty-nine people this year in the Olympic games. It’s
like a small country. Then there’s Katie Ledecky [Kathleen “Katie” Ledecky]
coming to Stanford as a freshman this fall with, what, five Olympic medals?
Absolutely astounding.
You know, people read, they watch the Olympics. They see Katie
Ledecky. Heck, you couldn’t get better advertising. She’s such a wonderfully
composed, mature young woman. It’s great. It’s absolutely great. No, we
didn’t consciously do it. I just think Stanford University, in general, is a star
that’s rising. In the 1950s, the admit rate at Stanford was 50 percent.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Wow.
[00:41:53] This year it was 5 percent.
Quite a difference.
[00:41:59] Yes.
Yes.
[00:42:00] I don’t think I necessarily agree with the hypothesis that the more
applicants the higher the quality. I only can talk about numbers I know. Even
with 17,500 students, you have 4,500 straight A students. You can’t admit
4,500, you only admit 2,600. I think they admit even less now because the
yield rate is so high.

103

Marine-Street:

I just wanted to ask you a question about your staff. What kind of qualities
did you look for when you were selecting people to work in admissions?

Chu:

[00:42:41] Good question. Fred Hargadon traditionally hired people straight
out of Stanford, Stanford graduates. They worked them to death for two
years and then they moved on. I wanted some continuity. For continuity, I
think one of the essentials was maturity, good judgment, maturity in both age
and wisdom, but also academic maturity so that you could make decisions
about young people. I hired four people with PhDs. And interestingly
enough, another one with a JD, and he was working in a law firm in Chicago.
I said, “You know, you’re going to cut your salary in half by taking this job.”
[laughter]
He said, “I don’t care. I hate being a lawyer. It was a terrible mistake.”
He’s now a general counsel in the development office.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Oh, interesting.
[00:44:07] Lots of people move from admissions to development, or some
other kind of academic discipline. Anyway, I think academics and maturity
and judgment, people whose judgment I could trust. I hired the first Jewish
admissions director I’d heard of in the admissions office. He was a young-well, he wasn’t so young. He was also a Stanford PhD. Actually, there was a
woman who came in roughly the same time who was also Jewish. You know,
there’d been this incredible debate nationwide in the 1940s and 1950s about
discrimination, about a cap being put on Jewish admissions. The president of
Yale actually said--it’s amazing he wasn’t sued for it--in the late 1940s, early
1950s, “We can’t have too many Jewish students at Yale.” Anyway, Jon was
104

very smart, but he had a rough edge to him. His heart and soul were in this
job. It did cause some tension because it wasn’t the easiest mix. The personal
qualities were not probably the best mix for the office, but I trusted his
judgment.
Marine-Street:

How did you and your team decide on these essay questions? I just want to
read you some.

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:45:53] Oh. Essay questions?
Yes.
[00:45:54] We used to have a retreat every year after the admissions decisions
had gone out. One year we went to Pajaro Dunes, another year we went up to
Mendocino. We did all our own cooking. It was very low-cost but very
stimulating kind of gathering. We would talk about the essay questions for
next year. They’re not easy to come up with, essay questions.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

Everyone would just sort of throw out some ideas?
[00:46:26] Yes.
Do you have a favorite that you remember?
[00:46:36] Do I have a favorite?
I found some here that might refresh your memory. “Whom would you like
to spend a day with and why?”

Chu:
Marine-Street:

[00:46:45] Yes.
“If you could authorize a new holiday, what would it be and why?” “If you
were to write a book, on what theme or subject would it be based and why?”
“Drawing on some personal experience, write a fable.” “If you could change

105

something in your life, what would it be and why?” Those are a few that I
have.
Chu:

[00:47:02] They’re all good questions. We did debate a lot. The essay is very
revealing, very poignant. It was almost as if when the students wrote, they
dissociated themselves from the reader and they just let it all pour out. Some
of the essays were heartrending. Absolutely heartrending.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Do you have any that have stuck with you over the years?
[00:47:43] One from a young, Korean male who talked about how he never
got any love from his father. Heartrending. They’re very personal. I
mentioned the one who was the admirer of Adolf Hitler. Maybe it was the
answer to, “If you could spend a day with anyone, who would it be?”
[laughter]

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

Oh, my.
[00:48:18] That was quite a showstopper.
We talked about some of the challenges and tensions. I wonder if there are
any that we haven’t touched on, whether they be Board of Trustees children,
or legacies.

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:48:45] We haven’t talked about legacies.
Oh, let’s talk about that then.
[00:48:50] The applicant pool at Stanford, in my day, was about 5 percent
legacies, so it wasn’t very high. The admit rate for legacies was roughly twice
that of the overall applicant pool. I mean not surprisingly because if you have
well-educated parents you’ve had a lot of advantages which prepare you well
for selective college admissions. Legacy tips, as they’re called. It’s all other
106

things being equal, if your mother or father attended Stanford and you were
in the Swim category, then it would tip you up, if there was room, into the
Admit category. It’s been much criticized as being not legal, unfair. You
know, it’s the Matthew effect. Them that has gets.
I must admit, I had some ambivalence about the legacy. I could defend
it because it helps build the Stanford family. Now--let’s go back to the AsianAmerican example. The fact that there weren’t many Asian-Americans then
precluded the fact that they could benefit from the legacy tip.
Marine-Street:

Did the development office kind of play a role in this, too? Was there extra
pressure if it was somebody who had been a notable contributor?

Chu:

[00:50:38] Oh, well, let me give praise to the development office. We shared
with them an applicant list. John Ford was vice-president for development
when I was dean of admissions. I never felt any pressure from him. I would
meet with him and we would discuss sensitive cases, and he was completely
understanding. I had one horrible, horrible case where the grandson of the
former chairman of the Board of Trustees was not admitted. I agonized over
that situation. His father was an alum, his grandfather had been chairman of
the board.
Fortunately I was not there, but I was told that when the young man
was at his grandfather’s memorial service in Stanford Chapel he was still
brooding about it. He applied from a very prestigious private school. He
wasn’t at the bottom of his class, but he was close to the bottom. You know,
what message does that give to other young students in that school? It would
be obvious why he was admitted. After I stepped down I was interviewed by
107

a radio station in San Francisco. It was a live interview. It was the year
Chelsea Clinton was applying to Stanford. The interviewer cavalierly threw
out, “Well, of course, you would automatically admit Chelsea Clinton.”
[laughter] I didn’t want to go into all the gory details of the selection process,
and I didn’t want to come out and say, “Well, of course, she would or-obviously--wouldn’t have been admitted.” I said something diplomatic.
“Students have to earn a place and--”
Marine-Street:

How did that work with VIP children? Would they interface with your office
if they were coming to visit the school or anything like that?

Chu:

[00:53:06] I once walked through my office when there was a senator sitting
there with his daughter. I just acknowledged his presence and said thank you
for coming, but that was about it. The chair of the Board of Trustees’
grandson, that was a really tough situation for me.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Why did you decide to leave this job?
[00:53:41] [laughter] It was a wonderful job. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I didn’t
enjoy every minute of it. It was incredibly challenging. It was incredibly
rewarding. At the end of seven years I was absolutely exhausted. In fact, I
decided after six years I wanted to step down and I went to Jim Rosse [James
Rosse], who was then my provost, and said, “Jim, I need to resign at the end
of this year.”
He said, “Oh, you can’t resign this year. I have too many deans
resigning this year.” He said, “Put it off for a year.”
I said, “Okay. I’ll do one more year.”

108

You know, you need a lot of energy for that job. My daughter had
already enrolled in college. She was admitted to Stanford by Fred Hargadon
but she chose to go East. My son was admitted by me. That was a tough
problem for me. I was upfront with my staff right at the beginning of the
year. I said, “Andrew is applying this year. I’ve tried to dissuade him. He
shouldn’t apply. He insists Stanford’s a wonderful place. He’s going to apply.
I do not want to see the application. John Bunnell, poor guy, he’s the one
dealing with it.” I did sign his admit letter.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did he attend Stanford?
[00:55:14] He went to Princeton. I said, “Andrew, look. Please don’t apply.”
He was a very good student. He was a triple-sport athlete. I knew he was
going to get in. His father was on the faculty. I said, “Your friends are going
to say the only reason you got admitted is because your mother was dean of
admissions. You don’t want people to say that about you.”
He said, “I don’t care. I want to apply to Stanford.”
Anyway, it’s funny, he didn’t come in the end. That situation was rather
awkward.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Yes, I’ll say.
[00:55:56] I had a number of awkward situations where I was dealing with the
children of very good friends of mine, some of whom were admitted and
some of whom were not admitted. That makes for awkward social
circumstances.

Marine-Street:

Yes, I’ll say.

109

Chu:

[00:56:16] Anyway, why did I resign? I was exhausted. There were two
national meetings of admissions deans a year, one called NACAC, National
Association of College Admissions Counselors, and the other, the College
Board. I was often asked to be a panel on things like women in the
admissions profession. I was very frank to young women. I said if I tried this
job with two small kids, I don’t think I could have done it. I mean the
demands, the physical and emotional demands, were so enormous. You had
to travel a lot. I thought that was a very disheartening message to give to
young women. I said, you know, you want the truth, or [laughter] do you
want me to tell you a lie and then you tackle it and you find you can’t do it. I
said I couldn’t have done it.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Why did you decide to write a book?
[00:57:32] I didn’t know what I was going to do. It’s funny how life unfolds. I
didn’t know what I was going to do after I stepped down, and so I had a nice
chat with the dean in education. I said, “Mike, I think I’d like to write a book
about my experiences, but I need somewhere to be housed. Can you house
me in the School of Ed?”
He was very nice and said, “Yes, you can be a lecturer in the School of
Ed.” I think I’d been in my office typing away for about six weeks and I got a
call from Jim Gaither [James C. Gaither], who was chairman of the Board of
Trustees at Stanford. Jim said, “Can I come and chat with you one day this
week?”
I said, “Sure.”

110

He didn’t say what it was about and I didn’t ask. When I hung up I
thought, what the heck could he be wanting to talk to me about. Anyway, so
Jim comes, a very persuasive guy [laughter], and said, “I’d like you to help run
the presidential search committee. I want you to be the executive vice chair.”
I said, “Jim, I’m on sabbatical leave.”
He said, “We can fix that.”
That’s all he said. “We can fix that.” What he meant by “We can fix that”
wasn’t entirely clear at the time. I thought, well this is an exciting opportunity
and it’s going to be short lived. We were very fast on that search. I think it
was over in five months. Gerhard Casper was selected as president and I
went back to writing my book.
Marine-Street:

Did you feel there was a market for the book? Why did you feel like you
needed to write a book?

Chu:

[00:59:30] There would have been a market for the book I didn’t write, which
was how you get into a selective school, or how do you make yourself
successful in applying to a selective school. I mean I followed the advice that
I think all English professors give to students writing about anything. You
have to write about what you know. Even though I knew the national scene,
my heart was really in Stanford. I decided to write about my experiences at
Stanford. I tried to find a publisher. I didn’t immediately approach Stanford
Press, but I tried to find a publisher nationally and they all said the same
thing, “Very interesting topic, but make it general rather than about
Stanford.” Anyway, then I had lunch with the director of the Stanford Press

111

and told him I was writing this book, and he said, “Of course we’ll take it. Of
course we’ll take it.” That was how I finished up at Stanford.
Marine-Street:

One last question for this session. As you look back on all the students that
you admitted, do you have any favorite sort of admissions success stories, or
exhilarating moments?

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[01:00:45] Oh. Do you watch the Rachel Maddow Show?
No.
[01:00:50] You should watch it on MSNBC. Rachel Maddow. She’s cited in all
the newspaper reports as the most intelligent person in public news. Rachel
Maddow was one of my admits. She went on to be a Rhodes Scholar. Cory
Booker, senator from New Jersey, went on to be a Rhodes Scholar. He was a
football player at Stanford. That’s a wonderful story. The co-founder of
LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman. Peter Thiel, the conservative entrepreneur. Peter
Thiel was not my favorite undergraduate because he was very conservative
and wrote in the Stanford Review and was often critical about minority
admissions and one thing or another.
Anyway, that’s five I think I gave you right there. I wouldn’t say they’re
my favorite admits. They’re people I still hear about today. Cory I got to
know reasonably well when we were in Washington D.C. I have a lovely story
about Janet Evans, the Olympic gold medal swimmer. When I was visiting
high schools kids used to ask me things like, “Well, what’s it like being a Janet
Evans at Stanford?”
I said, “Well, let me tell you the story.” Janet used to work out with the
men’s swim team, or some of the men swimmers. She went into a dorm one
112

day and knocked on the door and--I can’t remember the guy’s name that she
was working out with. She said, “Is Jack here?”
His roommate said, “No, I think he’s at swim practice.”
She said, “Oh, just tell him Janet came by.”
The roommate had no idea who she was. She was an Olympic gold
medalist, Stanford swimmer. You know, they all merge in this giant pool of
talent that’s here.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Any other thoughts on admissions before we call it quits for today?
[01:03:00] I’m sure I will retroactively, but I think I’ve exhausted you and
probably exhausted myself with this.

Marine-Street:

Okay.

PROJECT:

STANFORD STAFF ORAL HISTORY PROJECT

INTERVIEWER:

NATALIE MARINE-STREET

INTERVIEWEE:

JEAN H. CHU, INTERVIEW 3

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

SEPTEMBER 2, 2016

Marine-Street:

This is Natalie Marine-Street with the Stanford Historical Society Oral
History Program. Today is September 2, 2016. This is the third part of our
oral history interview undertaken as a part of the Stanford Staff Oral History
Project with Jean Chu. Okay, Jean, so when we concluded our last session, we
were talking about your time on the admissions committee. You told me that
you were happily on your sabbatical when you received an unexpected phone
call summoning you back to duty on the presidential search committee. Let’s
start by asking you to tell us why in the heck you decided to serve on that
committee.

Chu:

[00:01:13] [laughter] Oh, that one is a relatively easy answer. Yes, I was on
sabbatical in the School of Ed and trying to recover from seven years as dean
of undergraduate admissions. I should actually make a minor correction. I
wasn’t on an admissions committee. There wasn’t a committee. I was dean of
undergraduate admissions. One other minor correction. I was dean of
undergraduate admissions as Jean Fetter. That was my name in a previous
marriage so I’m Jean Fetter and Jean Chu. Okay.

115

I’m sitting in my office in the School of Ed. I get a phone call from
wonderful persuasive [laughter] dog-with-a-bone Jim Gaither [James Gaither]
who was chairman of the board of trustees. Jim says, “I’d like to come and
talk to you about something.” We set up a date and I think, what the heck is
Jim wanting to talk to me about? He comes into my office and tells me that
he’s appointing the committee for the search for the successor to Don
Kennedy [Donald Kennedy], and would I be the executive vice-chair of that
search committee. My first reaction was, “Jim, I’m on sabbatical leave.”
He said, “Oh, I know. We can fix that.” He never mentioned that again. It
was fixed but not by Jim. [laughter]
Why did I do it? Number one, Jim is a very persuasive person. When
Jim wants something done, you do it. Number two, that was a very important
committee. I’d worked at Stanford since 1975. Even though I’m not a
Stanford alum, I was incredibly loyal and felt a sense of responsibility to the
institution. I wanted to see its good works continue. This was a very
important committee so I said yes. I learned something incredibly important
from Jim in the course of this committee. He said something about, “Let’s set
some ground rules.” He said, “One, don’t ever tell me it can’t be done.”
Okay. Got that. [laughter] That was a wonderful way of approaching this
incredible assignment. It was an unbelievable committee.
There were six faculty and six trustees. The faculty, Condoleezza Rice,
John Shoven, Jim Sheehan [James J. Sheehan] from History, Joe Goodman
[Joseph W. Goodman] from Engineering, Saul Rosenberg from the Medical
School, and Steve Chu from Physics, who subsequently I married. That’s
116

another story. Those were the six faculty. They were all, I think, highly
recommended by their colleagues. Jim had done a lot of groundwork in
choosing them. Jim Sheehan was a wonderful co-chair with John Lillie, a
formidable Stanford trustee. I won’t go through the six trustee members
because I’m not sure I can remember all their names, except for Peter Bing,
another incredibly devoted trustee and alum.
The assignment was interesting. First of all there was a debate within
the committee about whether the committee’s role was to recommend a
person or a list of people to the board of trustees. This was debated so we
sort of left it in limbo to see how things would unfold. As it turned out, it was
a unanimous decision. We passed on one name--Gerhard Casper. This was
before the days of Skyping and video conferencing and so on, so it was a
huge time commitment. We met at least once every two weeks. The first
assignment was determining what the criteria were. This was interesting for
me, having come from dean of admissions. [laughter] Now we were picking a
class of one, but we had to have some well-defined criteria about what we
were looking for.
[00:06:26] One of my assignments was to call and benefit from the
wisdom of half a dozen institutions comparable to Stanford that had just
completed presidential searches. For example, Yale had just completed a
presidential search. That was very revealing. One of the common themes was
that there are just a handful of people in the United States who can do this
job for Stanford. That was very interesting. Another discussion was whether
we should we poll alumni. I thought, who’s going to answer all these letters
117

from all these alumni? That was me. [laughter] It was before the days of
email, so it all came in on paper. I think there were some phone calls, too.
Amazingly we started in October of 1991. By March of 1992, we had our
person. Relatively speaking, that’s fast for a presidential search.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Yes.
[00:07:57] Again, parallels with admission. The rumor mill. I got calls from
people well placed in other institutions saying, could you confirm that so-andso is a candidate for this position, and we’d never even heard of this person.
It was the rumor mill. All I could say was I’m sorry, I can neither confirm nor
deny that this person is a candidate. Somebody may have put A up to call B
to call C and thereby promote this person’s name. It was fascinating how it
worked.
We had a very interesting session with the director of communication at
Stanford, Terry Shepard, who early on impressed upon the committee the
importance of confidentiality. All it took was one leak outside the committee
and your case was blown. He told us some stories--or maybe I got this from
Harvard--when the Harvard search was going on students from the Harvard
Crimson would camp outside the Harvard Club in New York waiting to see
who was coming in. It’s amazing what people will do to get information. I felt
I was a member of the CIA or something, keeping all these closely guarded
secrets.

Marine-Street:

If there was only a small group of people who were qualified for this position,
how were those connections made? Did they answer an advertisement, or did
members of your committee reach out to them?
118

Chu:

[00:10:04] I don’t think any of them came from advertising. One interesting
debate was whether we should hire an outside search firm. [laughter] I think
opinion was almost evenly divided. The faculty said no and the trustees, who
were business- oriented people, said yes. We hired Heidrick & Struggles. With
all due respect to them, I don’t think they produced any useful information.
The information comes from collegial connections. It wasn’t unanimously
agreed that the person had to be an academic or in an academic position, but
it had to be somebody who was appointable to the Stanford faculty which
meant, almost by elimination, it was going to be somebody from a university
background. We didn’t get any names outside the United States.
The six faculty on the committee had connections everywhere and
could immediately find out whether a lead was worth pursuing or not. It was
amazing the way it worked. I can’t tell you the anecdotes that I have in my
head because it would violate the confidentiality of the process, which is still
impressed upon me nearly thirty years later.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Do you recall about how many candidates you considered for the position?
[00:11:55] It was a handful.
Did you fly to meet them or did they come here to Stanford?
[00:12:02] We learned from the Harvard Crimson experience. We did some
interviews in LA. We didn’t interview anybody on campus. It was always
outside of Stanford so that there would be no question of starting rumors.

Marine-Street:

This was in the wake of one of Stanford’s scandals, the indirect cost
controversy.

Chu:

[00:12:32] Yes.
119

Marine-Street:
Chu:

I wondered how that weighed on the mind of your group.
[00:12:38] I think if you asked each of the faculty members each would give
you a slightly different answer to that. Certainly it was a consideration. My
personal view is that it is unfortunate that Don Kennedy’s tenure was
clouded by that at the end because I think he was a wonderful president for
Stanford and did enormously good things.

Marine-Street:

Were there particular things that your group made a priority in a candidate
that you recall?

Chu:

[00:13:26] It had to be a person who was Stanford faculty caliber. That’s quite
a high bar to pass. It had to be a person who’d had experience, managerial
experience in a complex organization. Stanford has a medical school, a
business school, a law school, an engineering school, is not a trivial
management assignment.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Had you ever met Casper before?
[00:14:13] No. Not personally.
What was it about him that impressed the committee?
[00:14:21] First of all, he met all the criteria that we had agreed upon. His
experience as provost at Chicago and dean of the law school at Chicago were
wonderful qualifications for the job. He was much loved at Chicago. That’s
where our underground information [was useful.] [laughter]

Marine-Street:
Chu:

What was his personality like?
[00:14:52] That’s an interesting question. As you know, he’s German. It was a
particularly interesting personal connection for me because we were born in
the same month in the same year. I was in the UK and he was in Hamburg. I
120

think. He grew up in Hamburg. Our countries were at war. We both brought
a perspective of being World War II children. I think Gerhard, like many
Germans, has this underlying guilt about the way Germany treated Jews
during the Second World War. It was the personal connection for me going
on to be his assistant, when we were essentially the same age coming from
such different cultures. We both had imported accents. His English is perfect,
better than mine I would say, but he has quite a strong German accent.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did you ever talk about the war with him?
[00:16:24] Not in detail. We always had so much else to talk about. We’re
jumping over a little chasm here in that after he was appointed he asked me
to be his assistant. I mean he was new to Stanford. It is, as I think Marc
Tessier-Lavigne is already aware, a huge challenge coming in when you
haven’t been surrounded by the Stanford environment for a while. I think
Gerhard had one colleague at Stanford he knew, Jerry Gunter in the Law
School.
I was recommended to him as someone who knew the Stanford scene
very well and could help in the transition. I actually flew at his invitation to
Chicago for the day and after a few preliminaries in the conversation he said,
“Now, well, let’s pretend I’ve offered you the job and you’ve accepted the
job. Now, let’s carry on the conversation.” That’s how it went from there.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

Let’s go back to the committee for just one more question.
[00:18:05] Yes.
I’ve read a comment I think you made that it was the best committee that
you’ve ever worked on.
121

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:18:12] Yes.
What was it about that committee?
[00:18:16] First of all, the caliber of the people. I mean Condi Rice and Steve
Chu went on to be cabinet members. Different parties but cabinet members.
John Shoven went on to be dean of Humanities and Sciences. Joe Goodman
and Saul Rosenberg, even though they weren’t deans, were preeminent in
their fields. Jim Sheehan is a noted historian and had a wonderful sense of
diplomacy about him. He could ask piercing questions without offending,
which is an art. The trustee John Lillie, who was the co-chair with Jim
Sheehan, had led the Gap, I think it was, out of some business problems.
Jim Gaither had very successfully chosen people with personalities that
were almost destined to succeed together because they were all very
understanding, experienced, accommodating people and they wanted to work
together. I was a non-voting member of the committee. It was my job to sit
in and take notes--it was rather tedious assignment--take notes on everything
and then present them with a summary before the next meeting. I did speak
up in the committee, it’s just I didn’t have a vote. It was Jim Gaither and John
Lillie who said to me, “Don’t ever tell us it can’t be done.”

Marine-Street:

[laughter] Then you decided to take the job working as Gerhard’s assistant.
What did that entail?

Chu:

[00:20:39] It was a very interesting contrast to working with Dick Lyman.
With Dick Lyman I was new to the job and it was a trial by fire. I learned on
the job. I had very generic responsibilities. As I mentioned in the last
interview, my first assignment every day was to read his mail and decide how
122

to handle it. Gerhard, to his great credit, recognized I had been a dean, and a
dean has a lot of authority and autonomy. An “assistant to” is a rather
different role, and he could understand that I didn’t want to go back to being
the small cog between big wheels. He gave me a number of responsibilities
that I had not had with Dick Lyman.
For example, the ombudsperson reported to me instead of reporting to
the president. The director of public events, Lois Wagner, was asked to
report to me. I had a number of direct reports, which, for me, made the job
very interesting. Frankly, I think it wasn’t ideal for Gerhard. The
responsibilities as assistant to the president are so significant that I felt
sometimes I wasn’t doing him justice because of those direct reports.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

You were managing all these other functions?
[00:22:38] Yes. Sally Dickson was director of Cultural Diversity--that’s not
quite right--but she also reported to me. It was hard for them. In a way it was
like a demotion. Instead of reporting to the president they had to report to
the assistant to the president. On the other hand, Gerhard didn’t want a large
number of direct reports. It was a tricky balance for me to pull off. When I
decided to resign from that position--there were a number of reasons I could
come to in a minute,--I recommended to Gerhard that when he replaced me
he go back to the Dick Lyman model so that the person in the assistant job
wasn’t distracted by all these other rather significant responsibilities.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Sounds like they maybe needed two people.
[00:23:44] Yes. I juggled it.

123

Marine-Street:

What were some of the main issues that he had to deal with during his
presidency?

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:23:58] The UCSF/Stanford merger was a biggie.
The hospital merger with UCSF.
[00:24:05] The hospital merger came about after much machination and
thrashing about. Fortunately I was not involved in that one. He had [laughter]
an immediate political problem in that he had appointed a faculty search
committee for the job of provost, and then he appointed Condoleezza Rice
who was not the recommendation of the search committee.

Marine-Street:
Chu:
Marine-Street:

Oh, that’s interesting. Any idea why he did that?
[00:24:46] He thought she would be great on the job.
It’s curious to me that so many of the people in his inner circle were the
people who were on the presidential search committee. You, Condi, and then
Jim Sheehan headed up the committee on undergraduate education.

Chu:

[00:25:01] Yes. As I said, to my knowledge the only person he knew at
Stanford was Jerry Gunter in the Law School. He knew Jim Gaither had
chosen wisely in the people on the search committee, so he felt comfortable
with them. He was also very conscious about the role that women and
minorities should play at Stanford. Condi was well known and respected. I
think it took courage to do what he did.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Was there any blowback from the committee that you know of?
[00:26:01] They were loyal troops [laughter] but I think there was
understandably some disgruntlement.

124

Marine-Street:

Interesting. I imagine that does take guts to do that as one of your early
decisions as president.

Chu:

[00:26:18] He first appointed Jerry Lieberman as provost. A wonderful
choice. As I mentioned earlier in another interview, Jerry was a tower of
strength for me, and I think for many other faculty. Jerry was stricken with
Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Absolutely tragic, tragic end to a life. May none of us
go that way. It was painful to watch him decline. It soon became obvious he
couldn’t continue in that job. That’s when Condi was appointed.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Did you interact much with her in your role?
[00:27:08] Yes, I did. We were all in Building 10 on the ground floor, and her
office was two over from mine. There are a lot of overlapping responsibilities
with the president and the provost. Basically the provost is internal and the
president is external, but that’s a much too simplistic analysis of their roles.

Marine-Street:

This was a time when there was a lot of budget cutting as well at the
university.

Chu:
Marine-Street:
Chu:

[00:28:02] Yes. Yes.
Can you talk a little bit about that?
[00:28:06] It was painful. I mean any budget cutting is painful. I think Condi
was respected for the way she handled it. She had a great team. Tim Warner
[Timothy Warner], an experienced budget person under Ray Bacchetti
[Raymond Bacchetti], was a key player in helping Condi address this issue.
Not an easy thing to do. When you hear of Stanford’s fundraising prowess
these days, it’s hard to imagine there were ever any budget problems, but
there were.
125

Marine-Street:

Were there people, like different faculty members, storming into the office to
complain about budget cuts, or was it at a greater distance than that? How
personal did it feel to you?

Chu:

[00:29:09] There were some angry faculty. Yes. I mean a lot of it was
discussed and thrashed out in the Faculty Senate. I did not attend senate
meetings but I heard about them.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Any particularly memorable projects that you worked on during this time?
[00:29:40] There was one. I’m not saying I worked on it, but there were some
unfortunate fallouts with the budget cutting. There was a big to-do with a
senior Chicana staff member, Cecilia Burciaga, who worked in student affairs
at that time, and whose position was cut. That gave rise to a number of
protests from the Chicano students. Whether it’s South African divestment or
the Black Student Union, which Dick Lyman had to deal with, or the Chicano
incident when I didn’t appoint a Chicano staff member on the first pass
because I didn’t find someone I thought was qualified for the job. These are
very sensitive points within the community.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

You worked on that job until about 1997, I think? Is that right?
[00:31:03] Yes. In 1995, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Gerhard was
wonderfully understanding. It’s a devastating diagnosis to get. I had to have
surgery and radiation therapy. I think I had a week off for the surgery. Then,
during the radiation therapy I went every afternoon at 4:00 for thirty days. It
took its toll on me and at the end of that, even though my prognosis was
good, I said “Hello, Jim Gaither. It’s time for my sabbatical leave”--which I
hadn’t had in 1991 to 1992 because of the presidential search. I said to
126

Gerhard, “If it’s okay with you, I’d now like to resume my aborted sabbatical
leave.”
He was wonderful and said, “Yes, we should arrange that.” They had a
little search committee for my successor and I stepped down. As it turned
out, it was wonderful timing for me.
Marine-Street:

Let me ask you one more question. You served in this role for both Lyman
and Gerhard and you also knew Don Kennedy quite well. I was wondering if
you might just comment on what were the differences between those three
and some of the main differences in their approaches?

Chu:

[00:32:47] Let me start with the obvious similarity. I think they were all
wonderful, wonderful leaders at their time. Differences. They were
completely different personalities. Dick was the serious scholar, not as
comfortable socially as Don was. Don was a serious scholar but he’s very
gregarious, high energy, standing on the sidelines at football games, hail
fellow well met. Don was popular in a way that I think you would not call
Dick. Dick was highly respected and admired but popular is probably not a
word I would use to characterize him. Gerhard was somewhere in between
the two. He was much more sociable than Dick but not as sociable as Don.
[laughter]

Marine-Street:

Were there different kind of keys to successfully working with Gerhard
versus Dick?

Chu:

[00:34:15] I think when you’re in the “assistant to” position you’re the one
who has to adjust. You can’t object to the way that your boss is. [laughter]
That’s a given. I tried to do the very best I could in the jobs for all of them
127

and be as conscientious and helpful as I could to them. You do adjust to the
personalities. I think I had something in common with all of them.
Fundamentally I’m a serious person underneath, and therefore, I got on very
well with Dick. I found him a hard task-master, but I really admired him.
Don I admired because we both, you know, we let it hang out and we
particularly loved to interact with students. Gerhard, as I said, was
somewhere in between them, although completely different styles.
Marine-Street:

You mentioned that when you left this was kind of a good time for you to
leave active service at Stanford. Tell me what happens next.

Chu:

[00:35:49] Gerhard asked me to come back and do a couple of consulting
type jobs. One was working at the Institute for International Studies on an
Asia Pacific Scholars program. It’s funny. After I had “retired,” I almost felt
resentful that I didn’t have my time to myself again. I wasn’t entirely happy
doing that. But why it was the good time for me was Steve Chu, my husband-we had started a relationship after the presidential search in 1992--had been
rumored for years to be a candidate for the Nobel Prize in physics. Lo and
behold, in 1997, that came about. I was so grateful that I didn’t have a job
because the Nobel Prize is an overwhelming acknowledgement of your
academic achievement. It was staggering.
In fact, I took the call. It wasn’t from Stockholm. That’s how it’s
officially supposed to happen. Anyway, the phone rang. It was on my side of
the bed. They said would I confirm that Steve Chu was a co-winner of the
Nobel Prize in physics. I said, “I don’t think he’s heard officially.” I think it
was the Stanford News Service. They said, “Oh.” That day was so tumultuous
128

that it’s hard to get the train of events, except Steve never got the call from
Sweden because Stanford had just changed its area code from like a (415) to
(650), and the Swedes had the wrong area code so they never got through to
him.
Then from 4:30 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., we were getting all these calls from
the press saying could he comment on getting the Nobel Prize. Then some
television station wanted to come down and film us outside our house. We
lived on Alvarado Row on campus. They wanted to come and film us at 7:30
a.m. In addition to the television programs arriving at our house, the Stanford
News Service arranged all sorts of press conferences. Because Steve’s parents
were born in mainland China, the Chinese immediately claimed him as a
Chinese Nobel Laureate and there were apparently seventy press calls from
Chinese news agencies. The news service had to arrange a special press
conference for the Chinese press alone.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Oh, my.
[00:39:20] Yes. Anyway, that was the beginning. The Nobel Prize in physics is
always announced in October, which it was. You know, you read in the paper
X got the Nobel Prize in physics or in chemistry or whatever, and then you
forget about it. For us, this was the beginning of the unfolding of the process.
The prizes are actually awarded, as it happens, on my birthday, December
10th. We had to fly to Stockholm. You’re allowed to take fifteen people with
you, which is not an easy assignment when you have Steve’s mother and
father. That’s two. His two brothers. That’s another two. Their wives and
kids, and his kids. Steve had two children from another marriage. Winnowing
129

it down to fifteen people is hard. We all arrived in Stockholm and the Swedes
[laughter] gave one nonstop party.
The Nobel Prize ceremonies are in the afternoon of December the 10th
when the king actually formally hands over the medal. You bow to the king,
you bow to the Royal Academy of Science, and then you bow to the
audience. Then that’s followed by a small banquet of 1,300 people, a banquet
so elaborate that they have a book with the seating charts.
Marine-Street:
Chu:

Oh, my.
[00:40:58] All the Nobel Laureates are at the main table with the king and the
queen and the other members of the royal family. Then there’s music and
dancing. It’s all formal. Men are in white tie and tails, women in evening
dress. Then the next day is a little more of the same except it’s dinner for 100
people at the Royal Palace. Following that the laureates are sent out to
Gothenburg, Malmo, all the main Swedish towns to give lectures. By the time
we got on the plane to come back to the United States we were absolutely
exhausted. It was thrilling, an absolutely thrilling experience, but exhausting.
It doesn’t stop. It never stops.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

What do you mean it never stops?
[00:41:59] Once you’ve got a Nobel Prize you are on everybody’s list to do
things right, left, and center all over the world. The only place I think we
haven’t been is Africa. But we’ve been everywhere else and still continue to
travel like that. I was very happy I’d retired from my position.

Marine-Street:

Did you help Steve with the arrangements of any of that, or any of the speech
writing or anything?
130

Chu:

[00:42:32] The Swedish protocol is unbelievable. I was sent a letter telling me
exactly what to wear. I had to bring three different evening dresses--for the
dinner with the Karolinska Institute, for the dinner for the Nobel Prize, and
for the dinner at the Royal Palace, all of them formal dress. I had my own
things to worry about. [laughter] Steve was taken care of. They assign
someone high in the diplomatic corps to each Nobel Laureate. The
arrangements are impeccable. It’s like the Super Bowl in Sweden for the
Nobel Prize ceremonies. It’s just incredible.
Each Nobel Laureate is assigned a black limousine which waits outside
the Grand Hotel. The cars came in alphabetical order of Laureates, so Chu
came first. I was told I was never to open or shut the door. Somebody
opened it and closed it and I got in. One Nobel Laureate told me that after a
week of this in Sweden--somebody opening his car, shutting the car, driving
him somewhere--when he got back to his house in the U.S. and had to go to
work, he went to his car in the driveway and got in the back seat--

Marine-Street:
Chu:

[laughter] That’s funny.
[00:44:20] --because he was so used to being taken care of. [laughter] Anyway,
maybe I could conclude by saying the Nobel ceremony was a wonderful and
fitting closure to my time at Stanford.

Marine-Street:
Chu:

Good place to end. Thank you very much.
[00:44:39] You’re very welcome.
