Introduction
This oral history was conducted by the Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program, in
collaboration with the Stanford University Archives. The program is under the direction of
the Oral History Committee of the Stanford Historical Society.
The Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program furthers the Society’s mission “to
foster and support the documentation, study, publication, dissemination, and preservation of
the history of the Leland Stanford Junior University.” The program explores the institutional
history of the University, with an emphasis on the transformative post-WWII period,
through interviews with leading faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and others. The interview
recordings and transcripts provide valuable additions to the existing collection of written and
photographic materials in the Stanford University Archives.
Oral history is not a final, verified, or complete narrative of events. It is a unique, reflective,
spoken account, offered by the interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it may be
deeply personal. Each oral history is a reflection of the past as the interviewee remembers
and recounts it. But memory and meaning vary from person to person; others may recall
events differently. Used as primary source material, any one oral history will be compared
with and evaluated in light of other evidence, such as contemporary texts and other oral
histories, in arriving at an interpretation of the past. Although the interviewees have a past or
current connection with Stanford University, they are not speaking as representatives of the
University.
Each transcript is edited by program staff and by the interviewee for grammar, syntax, and
occasional inaccuracies and to aid in overall clarity and readability, while maintaining the
substantive content of the interview as well as the interviewee’s voice. As a result of this
editing process, the transcript does not match the recording verbatim. In the rare case that a
substantive deletion has been made, this is indicated at the relevant place on the transcript.
Any substantive additions are noted in brackets or by footnote.

Abstract
Sally T. Mahoney discusses her family, attending parochial schools in San Francisco, and her
undergraduate education at the San Francisco College for Women. She briefly describes her
graduate education in the Stanford English Department and her experience in the Stanford
Secondary Education Program. Mahoney discusses her work assignments in student housing
at Stanford, including a recollection of the time when Stanford students participated in
Mississippi Summer during the Civil Rights Movement. Mahoney recalls an initiative for
teaching freshman writing she pioneered as part of the Voice Project in collaboration with
Albert Guerard and personnel changes in the Dean of Students office.
Mahoney discusses the impact of the Study of Education at Stanford (SES) and her work on
the related Committee on University Residences and Campus Life. She addresses how
residential education was put into practice at Stanford beginning with Grove House and
other project houses and the impact of overseas studies programs on residential education.
She discusses the transition to coeducational student housing at Stanford and her role as an
advisor to Princeton University when it was preparing to become a coeducational institution.
She provides an account of Stanford’s policy changes regarding the issuance of prescriptions
for contraceptives at Cowell Student Health Service and the circumstances leading to the
closure of the Counseling and Testing Center.
Mahoney recalls her move to the Provost’s office and her role in directing the university’s
summer sessions. She addresses the climate of the university during the Vietnam War-era,
including student sit-ins, controversy over classified research, and the resignation of
university president, Kenneth Pitzer. She discusses the reorganization of the women’s
physical education department and the elimination of tenure-track faculty as a result and her
interactions with department chair Pamela Strathairn. She discusses the hiring of Andy
Geiger as athletic director, his philosophy of athletics, and his familiarity with sports media
and financing. She discusses the Committee on the Professoriate and female researchers’
demands to be allowed to be principal investigators and challenges to nepotism rules that
disadvantage women.

Mahoney relates the story of how she ended up as University Registrar. She explains the
computerization of the records in the Registrar’s Office and the impact of newly available
enrollment data on decision-making. She details her experience as the university’s Title IX
officer, including dealing with the problems caused by separate facilities for men and
women. In her position as vice president of student resources, she worked on the budget,
the recovery of indirect costs for admission and financial aid, and the merger of admissions
and financial aid.
Mahoney also talks about her experience and contributions in various positions outside of
Stanford, including the interim president of Agnes Scott College in Georgia, the interim
president of Mount Mary College in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the president of Our Lady
of the Lake University in San Antonio, Texas.
In conclusion, she reflects on what it was like to be one of the senior women in the
university’s administration and shares her thoughts on the increasing preeminence of the
university and its changing student body.

Sally T. Mahoney
Biography
Sally T. Mahoney is a San Franciscan by birth and upbringing, attending private schools
there and also the San Francisco College for Women, where she earned an AB with honors
(English). She came to Stanford on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to study English, and
after three years was “way-laid” into administration. In the 1990s she became a Sloan Fellow
in the Graduate School of Business where she took an M.S. in Management.
Over thirty years Mahoney served Stanford in a variety of positions of increasing operational
and policy responsibility. At different times people knew her as the Associate Dean of
Students, Director of the Summer Session, University Registrar, and Acting Vice President
for Student Resources. She was Stanford’s first Title IX officer. For 20 years, she was
Stanford’s liaison to the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), an
assignment that introduced her to a wide range of private and public colleges and
universities. Throughout that period she served in staff roles in the Provost’s Office. From
1980-83 she was the Resident Fellow at Larkin House--100 freshmen, four RAs (one of
whom has been a physician astronaut), and her. In 1989 she was elected an honorary
member of Stanford’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter and served on its executive committee.
In addition, Mahoney served on a wide variety of search committees, including a search for a
Director of Athletics and for a Dean of the Chapel (a search she chaired). Her rather
complicated retirement title is: Senior Associate Provost and University Registrar emerita.
In 1994 Mahoney left Stanford for what she thought of as her nomadic period. She served
Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, a college for women with Presbyterian Church
affiliation, as interim president. She also served in a similar role for two years at Mount Mary
College in Milwaukee, an institution sponsored by the School Sisters of Notre Dame; her
task there--to get college constituencies comfortable with the idea that their future presidents
would be lay people. From 1997-2001 Mahoney served in San Antonio, Texas, as President
of Our Lady of the Lake University. She returned to the Bay Area in 2003.

11

Over the years Mahoney has remained close to private educational governance. She served
for 15 years as a trustee of the Sacred Heart Schools, Atherton. She presently serves as a
member of the Board of Immaculate Conception Academy, a Catholic school for young
women sponsored by the Dominican Sisters of Mission San Jose. At the request of the
Congregation she undertook a feasibility study to determine whether ICA should transition,
as it has, to become a college prep/work study high school specifically for low and very low
income young women and a member school of the national Cristo Rey Network. She also
has served as a resource to the boards of other California private schools. In the late 90s
Mahoney served as Director of the national Association of Catholic Colleges and
Universities, Director of the United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County (TX), and as
Director of the national Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU).
Currently, Mahoney is vice-president of the Palo Alto Senior Housing Program, Inc.
(PASHPI), aka, Stevenson House, which provides independent living options for low and
very low income seniors.

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

JANUARY 28, 2014

Please note: part(s) of the following transcript(s) was (were) modified. The modification(s)
will be so indicated on the specific page(s) concerned.

Tracy: This is Allison Tracy. It is January 28, 2014. I’m here with Sally Mahoney to
conduct our first session of the interviews for the Stanford Historical Society
Oral History Program.
Sally, to start out, can you tell me a little bit about where you were born and
where you grew up?
Mahoney: [00:00:17] I was born and raised in San Francisco in the Upper Market-Twin
Peaks area of the city. I am one of three siblings, so we were a family of five.
My parents met in San Francisco, and each of them had come quite
independent of one another from Ireland, so they were immigrants.
My father came as the fourth of his brothers to leave home and came
to San Francisco about the time of the Irish Civil War after independence.
He left his oldest brother to inherit the land at home because Ireland has
primogeniture, and has it, I think, still. He was sponsored by his relatives of
some sort and came. He had learned plastering as a young man, and that was

13

the work he did, becoming a foreman for a general contractor in San
Francisco.
My mother had come at the age of twelve, in the company of another
twelve-year-old, by boat and train to San Francisco. Someone met them at
the boat and took them to the train. I’m not at all sure of that.
Neither of my parents went through Ellis Island, and the reason was
that they had second class tickets, and so they could get off at the dock that
other people got off at, something I learned only just a few years ago.
After the Second World War, the building industry changed and
general contractors began to work with subcontractors, so my father started a
small business and probably had at any one time himself and maybe two
other plasterers and a hod carrier, and sometimes if there was a lot of work-as there certainly was in the late forties--he would have larger crews. We, on
Sundays, visited the houses he had been working on, and it was a kind of
march to the ocean. San Francisco, and the Sunset [district], was really sand
dunes, and block after block those neighborhoods were built.
My mother, as I said, came as a twelve-year-old. She went to high
school in San Francisco, did various things after high school, and met my
father around 1933 or thereabouts. They married, bought a house in 1937, the
home we all grew up in. My mother was a stay-at-home mom.
Tracy: Were you the oldest or the youngest or the middle?
Mahoney: [00:04:00] I was the oldest. I have a younger sister, now deceased, and a
brother who was eight years younger than me, so I really never knew him

14

until he was an adult, because when you’re, for example, a high school
freshman, your eight-year-younger brother isn’t very interesting.
I was always a good student in school, and my parents didn’t put
pressure on me about education, but they also said it was important. I
attended a parish parochial school, Most Holy Redeemer, which was in what
is now the Eureka Valley-Castro area, K through 8—actually 1 through 8. I
didn’t go to Kindergarten. The school I attended was very very crowded. My
first grade was fifty-two youngsters, one teacher, and we did fine. About
three months ago, I went to the sixtieth reunion of my class, and we all
turned out all right.
Because I did well in the school, I had various little tasks. The principal
would appear at the door and ask me to take messages around to other parts
of the school. Initially, I was quite shy and I would come back and say there
was no one there, and she would take me by the hand and walk me up to the
classroom, which was usually the eighth-grade classroom, and they were big
and so I was scared. She would say, “I think they might be here,” and she
would open the door and she would push me in, and I would deliver this
message and come out. I got over that very quickly.
I went to a Catholic girls’ high school, Immaculate Conception
Academy at 24th and Guerrero. At the time I went to high school, there were
thirteen Catholic girls’ schools in San Francisco. There are now three. I am,
even as we speak, trustee of the school where I was also a student. Everyone
there expected that I would go to college.
Tracy: Was that a common expectation for students?

15

Mahoney: [00:06:52] No. My graduating class of seventy-three students had four
students who went to college. Most of them went and took exams to work
either for the city or the county or the fed, and spent, in some cases, their
whole lives, and in other cases simply until they married and started families,
in civil service kinds of work, mostly clerical.
But the four of us who went to college all did very well. I went to the
San Francisco College for Women. Its corporation dissolved in the 1970s. It
had become coed and kind of unfocused and didn’t last the late sixties, early
seventies. So the Jesuits at University of San Francisco bought the property.
It was not a merger, but it was the purchase of property. But I went there. I
thought about other schools in the area, but places like Santa Clara or USF
were not options. They were men’s institutions at the time. I knew about
Stanford and I knew about Berkeley. My parents didn’t want me at Berkeley.
It was too large and too public and too much of many things. And I didn’t
know anybody serious who went to Stanford.
Tracy: At that time.
Mahoney: [00:08:41] At that time. Now, that would have been 1957. I knew smart
people who liked to party, but I didn’t know any serious people. Somehow I
thought if I was going to go to college, I needed to be serious. [Tracy laughs.]
I went through a humanities honors program at the San Francisco
College for Women, which is not unlike the humanities special programs that
Stanford has had for years, kind of Great Books program over four years,
regardless of what your major was. I majored in English, had always thought
I would teach, and then in my senior year, several of the faculty suggested

16

that I think about applying for a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, and I did that
and received it, and received it to use at Stanford. So that’s how I got to
Stanford.
Tracy:

Sort of a repetitive question, as you were finishing up your undergraduate
work, was it typical, were they encouraging many other women to look into
graduate school, or was that—

Mahoney: [00:09:57] To education, to humanities, but not yet to law or business. Now,
I have several classmates who became doctors. By “several,” I mean three or
four. So somehow in that four-year period—and also the religious at Sacred
Heart, who owned and sponsored the college at the time, were serious
intellectual women, and are still. They were largely West Coast women, had
degrees from Stanford, from UCLA, from UC, and so were encouraging.
They were interesting, they were lively, and I enjoyed my undergraduate
career.
I did the student newspaper, which I edited, and I had a work-study
job, which turned out to be very useful over a long period of time. The vice
president for external relations, who also put out an alumnae newsletter and
did those kinds of things and did a little bit of fundraising, needed a workstudy student to help edit the alumnae newsletter, and that was my job for
four years, and I got quite good at it after four years. But it connected me to
a variety of people and it taught me what people did.
Many of the women that I interviewed for stories or followed up with
for one thing or another—the college was about 60 percent day students, 40
percent boarding students, and the boarders were from all over—and

17

because we were always interested in the newsletter in highlighting women
who were doing interesting things, I got to know a lot of women who did
interesting things. A judge, a woman who, I guess, when I interviewed her
was a lawyer, but in the Second World War she had been the first of the
women in the air force. They flew supply airplanes. I interviewed her and
asked if she had any questions for me, and she told me what she thought I
ought to do with my life.
So those experiences were very influential and they were probably
unusual, but because they were my bread and butter, I didn’t think of them
as particularly unusual. Stanford was a convenient place, it was close, it was
good, and so I came to Stanford.
Tracy:

At that point, in the early sixties, does it shed somewhat this country club
reputation?

Mahoney: [00:13:55] No. I didn’t know many undergraduates, but my colleague
graduate students had a dim view of Stanford undergraduates, and, of course,
because it was the English department, many of them taught freshman
writing, and that was where they got their dim view.
Everybody agreed Stanford students were bright, and people also
agreed that not all of them were rich. There was a mistake out there that
these were rich kids, but I think all my graduate student colleagues knew a lot
of undergraduates who were not well off, and so that didn’t figure.
The faculty was changing when I came. Terman [Fred Terman] and
Sterling had been building the faculty, first in science and engineering and
then in the humanities a department at a time, and history and English were

18

early on. When I came—and I didn’t realize it until much later—Professor
Albert Guerard was there. Now there are some people who would remember
his father, and he held the chair with his father’s name, but he had just been
recruited from Harvard, and he brought with him a younger faculty member,
Tom Moser-and Ron Rebholz was new, all sorts of people, and the
department was building. It had had some really fine people. A Shakespeare
scholar who was fine, [Virgil Whittaker]. Yvor Winters, and his wife, Janet
Lewis, were really fine scholars, very opinionated, and probably the newer
people would take the department in a different direction, but they
recognized and went after quality. History, the same thing.
I lived with four other women in what we called Richard Gross’s Gross
House. It was in Los Altos, and it had a septic system that was always
broken. He had gone to Swansea, Wales, on sabbatical, so we had the house
free for a year. I was the correspondent with him. That was my piece of
the—
Tracy: Your contribution.
Mahoney: [00:17:13] Contribution to the whole. And I had to tell him that we would
have plumbers in and that we had the bad news that his septic system was
going to have to be replaced. So that’s how we referred to the place, Richard
Gross’s Gross House.
The next year, I lived with a graduate student who was finishing a
dissertation on William Faulkner and who then went to the City College of
New York in a tenure-ladder position, but left there and went to San Diego
State, where she was for forty years before her retirement.

19

Then the second year, I went into the SEP program, the Secondary
Education Program. I did summer and then I taught full-time, and I came
back the next summer. I taught at MA (Menlo-Atherton), and it taught me
that I did not want to teach secondary school, even though any number of
my parents and their friends thought it would be a good thing for me to have
a credential. Well, I got a credential, but I certainly didn’t want that
environment. And I didn’t want it not because I didn’t like the students. I
loved them. I didn’t like the teachers’ lounge. They were unhappy, and I
thought, “I don’t want to work with unhappy people,” because I came to
find out from other people in the program that that was a common
experience.
So I came back to the department and started again, worked with
George Sensabaugh on some seventeenth-century materials, and that year to
fund myself in part, I became an R.A. at Storey house where Susan Schofield
lived, but she was a sophomore.
Tracy: I read that somewhere. That’s funny. I wanted to ask you about that because
I came across that in an article or something that I read.
Mahoney: [00:19:27] Please have a cookie.
Tracy: I will.
Mahoney: [00:19:33] It was interesting that Mary Duryea Decker even hired me,
because I’d never lived in a dorm. I’d been a commuting student to college. I
didn’t know what a dorm was. But I had some skill at making people feel that
the community was worth their time, and although there were lots of rules
for women that were not rules for men at Stanford—hours and all that kind

20

of thing—I managed to walk a kind of path that didn’t disturb the universe,
and I really enjoyed that year.
At the end of that year, I got a call from the associate dean of women,
a woman named Bonnie Fitzwater, a Texan who still had a Dallas accent, and
she asked if I would consider being the director of Branner Hall, which was
the only women’s residence on the Wilbur-Stern side of the campus. That
idea was sufficiently preposterous that I said yes.
In the middle of that year, the then dean of women, Lucille Allen, got
herself into serious hot water. It was alleged that she had alleged that
freshmen English T.A.’s were seducing freshmen women. Now, those people
so accused, even on the rumor side, were my friends. Over the course of
several weeks, she resigned. She had come to Stanford from Cornell and was
quite a distinguished person among deans of women nationally, but she
wasn’t good for us at the time.
That also was the year of the Mississippi Summer followed by the
autumn in which various civil rights activists went to Mississippi to register
people for the mock elections, and among the sponsors, as undergraduate
R.A.’s were called, my head sponsor went, and this was in October after that
dreadful summer. Bob Byers, the director of the news service—there was a
cluster of people from my dorm, Marlie Shenck, Pat Stell, David Harris went.
Several people went, men and women, and they flew to New Orleans and
then they got a car with Mississippi licenses and went to Mississippi. What
Bob Byers understood was that the thing that could be done to keep them
safe was to give them a lot of news spotlight so that people knew who they

21

were, knew that reporters were following them, and he went to Mississippi
and he made contact with people who could help him with that agenda.
They were there at least a week, maybe longer, and Marlie was tasked
by the dean of women, who had authorized them to go, to call me every
night at seven o’clock—so it would have been ten o’clock in Mississippi—
just to check in, that they were still all right. So I would stay in my apartment
and wait for that call to come.
The night that we thought they were going to leave Mississippi, Marlie
called. Every night students would gather in my living room, sit on the floor,
and wait for Marlie’s news. So I would bring the phone into the living room
and talk with her. I said something like, “How are you leaving Mississippi?”
And instead of answering me, she hung up.
I put the phone down, because I knew the dean of women was going
to ask me that question, and I said to one of the graduate students who was
there, I said, “She hung up on me when I asked how she was going to get
out.”
And one of the freshmen, this childlike person, looked at me and with
great wisdom said, “That phone was probably tapped, and if she told you,
she might not get out.”
And I said, “Oh.” Then I said to myself, “That’s what I could tell the
dean.” [laughter] And that’s what I told the dean. And they got back two or
three days later.
The civil rights activity was the beginning of something at Stanford.
Faculty supported the students who engaged in that work, and faculty were

22

generous in letting them go and letting them make up work and do whatever
had to be done.
So in the middle of that year, this, quote, “scandal” came, with respect
to the dean, and I got called by Don Winbigler, who was then the dean of
students. Don later became academic secretary for the university. He was a
professor of drama. He called me to his office, and I had no idea why, and he
asked me would I consider leaving Branner next year and going to Roble.
Roble was on the other side of campus where other women’s dorms were,
and it was larger by 50 percent than Branner. And I said, “Well, yes, but I’m
barely getting to know Branner.”
He said, “Well, you know Dean Allen resigned.” Dean Fitzwater, her
associate dean, had resigned, and then Betsy Avery and Judy Hannemann
resigned. Well, I was too dumb—and the director of Roble had resigned, and
maybe the director of Lagunita had resigned. And he said, “You have more
experience than anybody else on the staff.” Now, I had ten months’
experience. And he said, “Roble is the place where most of our alumnae
lived.” Branner didn’t come along until later.
And I said, “Sure.” Well, that year was very impactful for me, because I
made a friend of—and he made a friend of me—of Albert Guerard, who had
a lot of Ford Foundation money for something called the Voice Project. The
Voice Project was a different approach to the teaching of freshman writing.
So he wanted to make sure that even though I had this full-time job, he went
to the dean and asked if I could please teach freshman writing again, and he
wanted me engaged in the Voice Project.

23

Then over the course of the year, because he had money—nobody else
did, but he did, and he also had people like the novelist John Hawkes, who
came out to teach writing. I mean, it was a lively, exciting, intellectually
exciting group.
I went to him and I said, “I’d like to have an art exhibit, a set of poetry
readings, and a whole creative thing, maybe for four or five days including
the weekend, and invite faculty,” and it would be all freshmen from Stern
and Wilbur and Branner and Roble. It’d be good, and we could publicize it
through the freshman writing program. I knew kind of what I wanted to do,
but I thought it would be worth people’s time and people would take it more
seriously as a real thing if he put up some money for some prizes for
drawings and we had several sets of prizes. Well, he did, and it was quite
wonderful.
I didn’t quite understand at the time, though I think this had something
to do with it, I had been a graduate student in English. This was the English
department that had been tarnished by these allegations. Whether they were
true or not true, it hadn’t been good. Suddenly, my interaction with the Dean
of Students Office, which is what I worked for, as the director of Roble, I
belonged to the Dean’s Office, but I also belonged to the English
department. That helped make peace and good working relationships. So we
did that and had a terrific time. It was great fun because faculty came and
read, and students got up and read their poems, and the faculty’s poems were
equally acceptable to be heard, and it was very nice.

24

At the end of that year, Don Winbigler decided to leave the Dean of
Students Office, and something was set up for him to be academic secretary,
and I didn’t quite understand what that was about. So I’d been one year at
Branner and one year at Roble. I then went into the Dean of Students Office
and was—assistant dean of women. I was assistant dean of something for
residences, and the idea was to work with the faculty to get advisors into
residences and to encourage resident fellows and to encourage the kind of
thing I had done at Roble elsewhere.
Joel Smith came in as dean of students. Now, Joel Smith had no long
history at Stanford. He had gone, I think, to Oberlin and graduated from
there. He had been a Marshall Scholar to Oxford. At Oxford he met people
from Stanford who were working on degrees. No, they weren’t from
Stanford. They were people working on Oxford degrees who wound up at
Stanford. Ron Rebholtz and Martin Evans were two.
He came back and went to the University of Wisconsin to law school,
but was looking for other things because he really didn’t want to practice law.
It was intellectually interesting, but courtrooms and litigation and what
people did in lawyers’ offices didn’t interest him. Someone suggested that he
get involved with the university, and how he got here, I don’t know, but he
was in the Development Office, I think doing some legal work for Daryl
Pearson, working for Ken Cuthbertson. And all of a sudden, he was the dean
of students. Boom!
After a short time, there were a lot of different kinds of activities going
on, Berkeley protests had started. We weren’t Berkeley, but there were

25

activist students asking questions and questioning authority and beginning of
discussions about why do women have rules that men don’t, those kinds of
things.
So I’m in the Dean of Students Office, Joel came to the Dean’s Office.
Don had gone to some other place on the campus for a while and had his
little office under the stairwell. He asked to see me, and I thought this was
nice. This was the new guy. And he said, “I want you to stay on.”
And I said, “Oh?”
And he said, “Not many of your colleagues will be staying on.”
Tracy: So he was cleaning house a little bit as dean of students?
Mahoney: [00:34:47] Yes, he was. The dean of men went away, various people went
away whom I didn’t know very well because I’d only been there eight or nine
months. All these changes happened, and I’m the last hired and I’m not the
first fired. I’m the first kept.
Tracy: Interesting.
Mahoney: [00:35:10] I took to saying to people, as the history of my activity at Stanford
got longer, “I’m the last employee of the last dean of women at Stanford.”
Then things changed and I became somebody else’s employee over time.
Then Wally Sterling announced his intention to retire, and as part of
that announcement, he announced Study of Education at Stanford (SES). It
was one of these gatherings of the entire Academic Council, which used to
meet once a year, and they heard a State of the University Address from the
president. As a dean, I went to that meeting. All the deans in the Dean of
Students Office went to that meeting. He announced that he would be

26

retiring and that in his last year he would be establishing a Study of
Education at Stanford, which, when completed, would help his successor
have the view of the faculty and, indeed, the university as to possible
directions. It would be a kind of relook at things. But when you look at the
Study of Education—have you seen those books?
Tracy: Yes.
Mahoney: [00:36:50] I am looking for some of those books, because I have two of
some and none of others.
He was not president any longer when the various reports were
generated, and it was interesting to me that the letter from the Steering
Committee turning over the reports of the Study of Education at Stanford is
addressed to three people: Chancellor Sterling, Acting President Robert
Glaser, and President Designate Ken Pitzer.
As I think about what SES was, there was a committee that produced a
report on university residences in campus life. There was one on admission
and financial aid. There was one on graduate education, which wasn’t very
good, and it got redone. There was one on advising and counseling, one on
undergraduate education, one on the extra curriculum.
So what you see in SES—and then I was part of Joel’s work. Joel was
tasked to staff the Committee on University Residences and Campus Life
somehow, which was chaired by Lew Spitz, a professor in the history
department. He took me to the first meeting of the committee and
announced that he was its staff but I would do all the work, which was fine. I
mean, it was interesting. But everybody laughed. So I became quite engaged

27

in how people were thinking about residences, and I had had the history of
working with the English faculty at Roble and with faculty residents, as we
then called them, in some of the dorms. There was an image about what
both the faculty wanted to accomplish, and what Joel and I—I had less
policy influence, but I certainly agreed I wanted to support.
As I think about the SES, as I see it, Sterling and Terman built the
faculty. SES said pay attention to students and make sure you have a student
body that can benefit from the faculty we are trying to bring together here.
So whether it’s the admission and financial aid report or the residences’
report or the extra curriculum report, the focus is on your graduates and the
focus is on raising the bar, integrating intellectual life and the social lives of
students, finding a place for athletics and other parts of the extra curriculum,
all of those kinds of things.
So I dutifully went to those meetings once, often, every other week and
sometimes more often and did research, and we then had an opportunity
to—Bob Glaser was, I think, acting president, and there was the, you know,
when you have lemons, make lemonade. Some fraternity up in the cluster on
the lake, I think maybe the Phi Delts, got themselves into some kind of
serious trouble and were suspended and had to vacate the building. [Tracy
laughs.] Well, Joel said, “Let’s put something experimental and interesting in
there.”
So that was when the next thing I knew, I had to take care of Mark
Mancall, who was known as an assistant professor of history who was on the
Steering Committee of SES—maybe he was an associate professor, but he

28

wasn’t more than that—and who had wild ideas that were interesting and
was, a little bit in part because of his size, a bull in a China shop.
So we made Grove House work, and Grove House was to be men and
women. It was our first venture into coed housing on the Stanford campus.
It was to have an intellectual dimension that was course-based, and it was to
engage faculty and other visitors. It had an agenda. My job was to make sure
it happened, and I can’t remember what happened to make the board agree
to this, other than it was just exciting and it was an experiment, and the Phi
Delts would come back.
I had roles like liaison to the food service. Mark wanted after-dinner
coffee in the living room so the faculty could come, and there would be
cookies and coffee. The food service was used to closing down when people
stopped eating in the dining rooms. When Mark asked for this thing that he
thought was fairly standard, and was when he had lived in Harvard houses as
a graduate student, and it seemed ordinary to him. And it was ordinary—and
this is important—overseas. The food service saw cockroaches. People will
leave this debris.
Well, Mark ran the house by saying, “This is Mancall’s Maoist
democracy. Everybody can express an opinion, and Mancall decides.” That’s
what that meant. And one of the things that Mancall had decided was that
after coffee and cookies, two or three students of an evening would take the
responsibility for cleaning the place up so that there would be no
cockroaches or anything else untoward. Well, the director of university food

29

service, Maxine Anderson, by the end of that year would have done anything
for Mark Mancall. She was excited. The kids were excited.
Then SES and Joel said to me, “We have to make this bigger.” So we
had four project houses, two of them in Stern. One of them was going to be
Grove House because it needed a place, and it went to Donner. And another
place in Stern, where Bob Freelen was with Marcy, Freelen, who was then his
wife, and he had a daughter. Then in Wilbur, John Chowning and somebody
else. So there were four houses. Freelen had a social service house.
Chowning had a music house. Mancall had his Grove House.
I went to the board meeting where that was discussed and where the
presentation was made by Smith. The lever was: this is like overseas studies.
Europeans, we don’t have places in Europe where men live in one house and
women live in another. Europeans don’t understand that. We’re lucky to be
able to get a facility. But we have usually two faculty couples and forty or
fifty students at Beutelsbach or wherever, and there’s intellectual energy. It’s
exciting. People love their overseas experience. There are two memories that
the typical Stanford student of the time and even since have, and one of
them is where did you live as a freshman, and the other was what was your
overseas studies campus. So those were compelling experiences.
So Joel made the presentation to the board, which was a little nervous
about coed housing, based on the experience of overseas, that this wasn’t all
that novel, it was simply bringing overseas home. We started overseas studies
because we wanted to experiment, and that was well developed now, so we
should bring it home. They bought it.

30

Two psychologists or social scientists of one sort of another, one,
Nevitt Sanford, and the other, Joe Katz, were part of an institute on the row,
and after we opened the four houses, they did a series of questionnaires and
observations of the four houses, and it was novel enough so that we got
phone calls from all over the country about these four houses.
By this time, I am your friendly assistant dean, then associate dean for
residential education. I’m not assistant dean of women for residences. I’m
residential education, which is what the SES wanted it called. Nevitt Sanford
and Joe Katz came up with a paper that said coed houses operate on the
basis of an incest taboo and that people were not sexually active with one
another in coed houses. Now, they didn’t say these students may be active
with people in the house next door, but they said this is family life. I didn’t
know whether their research was good, bad, or indifferent, but when I got
phone calls, McCall’s magazine, Good Housekeeping magazine, deans at various
schools, I quoted Nevitt Sanford and Joe Katz, said, “I see no reason to say
anything else. I see this too,” and then put the phone down. [Tracy laughs.]
But I must have had, in the course of a year, fifty calls, and I am forever
grateful to those two men because it allowed us to move forward.
Then gradually the whole system turned over. Going back to the
forties, there was a sorority system at Stanford, and women who were not in
sororities—or after sororities, the whole question of how you were going to
fill both the sorority houses and the other houses, and what everybody
agreed to was a random draw, and so there was the women’s draw. It was

31

operated by a woman who ran the Housing Assignment Office, and we
adapted that for access to coed housing.
Up to that point, women had to live on campus. Men didn’t have to,
and men who didn’t live in fraternity houses tended to live off campus. It
was affordable. And nobody wanted to live in Stern, so Stern was quite
empty. It had a vacancy rate that was not something that made the financial
people very happy. Well, when we overturned the system, men came back to
campus because campus was more interesting than cooking on your own
ramen noodles off campus.
One day we were visited by this gentleman from the Woodrow Wilson
School at Princeton, and he was doing a study about whether Princeton
should go coed as an institution. I said various things to him, and mostly I
didn’t understand what he was saying, because Stanford had been coed from
the beginning. The five hundred that Mrs. Stanford had instructed wasn’t in
her day a really small number, and men had been gradually honored in the
breach as a proportion over the years.
So our limit on women students up to coed housing was the number of
beds that could be put in Roble and Branner. Once we had coed housing, we
didn’t need to limit the number of women. Now I don’t know that anybody
had that in mind. I know nobody had that in mind, but it was the
consequence that meant there was flexibility about numbers. There was a
crisis in the number of women who accepted. Admission was too high. You
got into double singles and triple doubles and all those things. But coed
housing gave us that freedom and gave the Admissions Office freedom.

32

Tracy: One question in thinking about this progression of women’s housing. When
did all of these sort of rules and regulations special to women, like curfew
and whatnot, when in the process did that go by the wayside?
Mahoney: [00:53:49] When we went co-ed, and I remember this vividly, because it was
clear to me that nobody honored it in the four project houses and no one
asked any questions. Certainly Joel Smith was not going to ask me questions
about that, as the dean of women once upon a time asked me. That was not
part of it.
But it was clear that our choices were to apply the same rules to men as
to women or vice versa, and I remember that someone down in the
Provost’s Office which had a sizeable staff.—there were two people in the
Provost’s Office who were interesting to me. One was Howard Brooks, who
was vice provost and who, interestingly, had a daughter who lived at Roble
when I was its director. I remember once he came into my office on his way
to visit Joel Smith, and he said, “Oh, I just wanted to know who you were. I
don’t think we’ve ever met. I’m Howard Brooks, and you know my
daughter.”
And I said, “Oh, sure, I know your daughter,” who was by then a
junior.
He said, “She thinks you’re good,” and he walked out.
I said, “Thank you.”
The other was Herb Packer, and Herb Packer was a visionary for the
university and for faculty governance, which is, of course, one of the books
of SES. But somebody had an idea down there that what we should do is ask

33

the parents of women students to give us permission to let their daughters
not have to have rules. And I remember hearing that at ten o’clock in the
morning at some meeting, and I was going to have to be the enforcer of this,
the administrator enforcer of it. I went back to my office, and I had behind
my desk a red IBM Selectric typewriter with a correction ribbon, and I simply
sat down and wrote a memo to Joel Smith which basically said, “We can’t do
this. I am willing not to see us go with co-ed housing if we have to do this.
We want out of the in loco parentis, and this puts us squarely in for the
foreseeable future there.”
It must have been Glaser was still the acting president, and Joel—I still
remember this—he took my piece of paper with its misspellings and its runon sentences, and he took it down to Building 10. And the next thing I knew,
Herb Packer was at the door of my office saying, “You persuaded us.” I
didn’t know—I mean, I knew who he was. He was this little man who always
had a different jacket on every day. He had more clothes than anybody I ever
knew.
I didn’t know Joel had taken my paper. And Joel was with him, and
Joel said, “We’re going to take it your way.”
And I said, “Oh, thank you.”
Then three months later, Joel said to me, “You’re now not assistant
dean of students; you’re associate dean of students.” So I think that memo
got me a promotion. But you just couldn’t take the place co-ed and have
those rules.

34

This nice man from Woodrow Wilson School went back to Princeton,
and the next thing I know, Joel Smith was in my office saying Princeton
wants to invite me to be a consultant to Princeton’s plans to go co-ed, and
would I go to Princeton next week. There was a blizzard. Instead of going to
Newark, we wound up going to Pittsburgh and then coming back by bus and
train.
I missed the big session, but I was part of the group that included
Peggy Bunting, the president of Radcliffe College, the woman who was out at
UCLA who had been the president of Barnard, and various other people.
They still had in mind parietal rules, etc., for these new women to Princeton.
What I quickly understood—Neil Rudenstine [Neil Leon Rudenstine] who
subsequently became the president of Harvard, was dean of students at
Princeton, and Goheen [Robert Francis Goheen] was the president of
Princeton, and Bowen [William G.Bowen], who became president of
Princeton, was the provost.
I get there. I’m late. One of the things I know is all these women are
far more distinguished than I am. I’m an associate dean in a Dean of
Students Office, and these people are presidents of their institutions, they are
learned, but I have the experience of this kind of thing. And Princeton is
losing students to Stanford, men students, because they were all men at the
time. I arrive and they give me this kind of protocol that has been suggested
to them about women at Princeton.
We’re having breakfast since I wasn’t there the night before. I realized
that I’d just better speak up, and I say, “The women who are going to sign up

35

to apply to Princeton are doing so because they’re going to be pioneers, and
they know it. You’ve been here since before the Republic. There is abroad in
the land a kind of resistance to these [parietal rules]. It’s not yet taken hold. I
don’t think that the women who come here as pioneers are going to put up
with it, unless, of course, you’re prepared to tell Princeton men that they
have to be bound by the same rules,” basically my argument at Stanford
some months before.
They all looked at me and they said —I remember Bowen was the first
to speak, and he said, “You’re right, of course.” He looked over at Goheen
and said, “Who do you think we have to sell this to?” And it was this man
from the Wilson School and Rudenstine, and Rudenstine was relieved.
I then went to a session with Princeton students, and I knew somehow
that Princeton was going to make this transition OK, but they didn’t have
any experiences that Stanford took for granted. I met with a group of
students, and this really smart-alecky kid said, “You know what this game is.
Princeton needs more students, and they’re having a hard time getting men,
so they think they’ll continue on a better trajectory towards more men if they
also have women and that they can get quality up and numbers up at the
same time.”
And I said, “Well, no one has said that to me.”
And he said, “Trust me. Bowen is an economist.”
And I said, “OK.”
I must have asked some question about what things do you think might
be unsettling to the men at the Princeton if there are women here, and this

36

same kid said to me, “Well, we’re going to complain when the line for
reserved books in the library is longer, and we’re going to blame the women
when, in fact, we should be blaming Bowen for increasing the size of the
student body.” He was absolutely right.
I went back afterwards and said to Bowen, “Your students are pretty
smart, and this is what they’re saying. Let me pass it on to you.” And he just
laughed.
So I came home. Princeton went coed, but one of the last things they
said to me as we toured, they kept saying to me, “What did you have to do
when you made men’s dorms OK for women as well as men?”
And I said, “Well, not much. We did make sure that every hall had an
ironing board and an iron and a mirror.”
“Well, what did you do with the urinals?”
“Well, we put boxes around them.”
“Well, what did you do with the furniture? Because men are taller than
women.”
And I said, “Some time ago, we bought 80-inch beds for everybody,
and that’s what men need.” But what I didn’t understand was that only once
in its 300-year history had Princeton ever bought furniture for students. It
didn’t know anything more about furniture than the most naïve person in
any school I can think of. The reason was that in the old days when
Princeton students were from a rather narrow band of affluent families—
[telephone interruption]

37

Tracy: So before we stopped, we were talking about Princeton’s ability to buy
furniture.
Mahoney: [01:05:07] Well, Princeton students had brought their own furniture with
them, and at the end of every spring, seniors sold their furniture to the
students who were behind them, and then other students sold to freshmen,
who brought some things in. It must have been a big yard sale, but some of
these things were antiques.
As they began, really long before they started admitting women, they
began to recruit students who didn’t have the financial means to bring
furniture to school. So once, some years before, they had bought furniture
for the dorms and told students who had furniture, “If you want an easy
chair, keep it, but, by and large, the university will provide basic furniture.”
So that set the stage for them thinking, “Oh, my, what will we have to
do for women?”
And my answer was, “Not very much. The women will maybe decorate
their rooms in a way that’s different from the way that men do, but that’s
because their mothers and fathers will have accompanied them to school in
some cases. But other than that, you don’t have to worry about this,” which
kind of amused me, but relieved them.
So that was the Princeton thing, and there is a little tiny book about the
recommendation that Princeton go co-ed that thanks the group of us who
were their advisors. So that was a fun thing that happened in that period of
time after we got ResEd [Residential Education] sort of going.

38

Tracy: I think it’s good to point out that the idea of Residential Education was really
something that developed, not just at Stanford but was not necessarily a
recognized field, and, as you said, you were given the term “Residential
Education,” but the concept was developed over this time that you’re
describing at Stanford, that it wasn’t as cohesive of a thing when you came
into Branner and Roble.
Mahoney: [01:07:53] Oh, absolutely not, as evidenced by the fact that men didn’t want
to stay at Stern, moved off campus. But for Stanford, its origins—or not its
origins, but it drew on the experience of overseas studies, which, while not
unique—certainly not unique now. Stanford was among the first institutions
in this country to have overseas study sites where people came together in
enclaves with faculty, and we learned a lot from that.
What I was thinking the other day was I [next] moved into doing some
other things with Joel. Doug Davis, who was a man who had been director
of Wilbur at one point and then came into the Dean’s Office, got more
involved with Residential Education. Joel would have me do things, and one
of them was the Cowell thing.
Sometime before I came to Stanford, and I don’t know how much time
before, but it must have been the late fifties, early sixties, because that would
have been the period of time when the Food and Drug Administration
approved oral contraceptives, Cowell Student Health Service prescribed
contraception when students came and asked for it, and they didn’t make
distinctions between graduate students and undergraduates. I don’t know
that they told anybody, but they were physicians, and that’s what they did.

39

A parent of an undergraduate student—and I don’t know anything
about it other than this outline—discovered that their daughter was a user of
contraception that she had acquired at Cowell Student Health Service. The
family threatened to sue the university because they said she was a minor,
and to do such a thing without a parent’s permission was to inflict a battery
on a child. So very quickly, Sterling said, “No.” It wasn’t clear whether he
said no to graduate students, but he certainly said no to undergraduates. So
that was the policy. I didn’t think much of it one way or the other. I didn’t
know much about it.
When Sterling stepped aside, the acting president was a physician; he
was dean of the medical school, Bob Glaser. Joel came into my office one
day, and he said, “Mac Osborn [Maurice Osborn MD] and I have a task for
you and Marion Shikamura [Marion Shikamura MD]” whom I knew to be
one of the really fine doctors at Cowell and very elegant and calm and
thoughtful and sensible in many ways. He said, “We need to find a way to
deal with the contraception issue, and I want you to find it.” [Tracy laughs.]
And it was he who told me about this history of this policy.
I didn’t know Marion very well, but I called her, and what we agreed to
do was she would call physicians at the Student Health Services around and
about, and I would call deans of students, vice presidents for student affairs,
whatever, and see if anybody would tell us what they did, both in California
and outside. California was relevant because there are state laws. Indeed, to
go back to housing, it is the state hotel code that defines where you can put
men and women in a coed house, and in a hotel downtown in San Francisco,

40

if your rooms don’t have bathrooms and the bathrooms are in the hallway,
there have to be two sets, that men can use one and women can use the
other. So state law applies to all sorts of things, honored now mostly in the
breach or with an addition of facilities.
So I got on the phone. Everybody was holier-than-thou and said, “Of
course not. We would have to have parent permission.” And when you say
“parent permission” to me, my blood boils. I called Marion. Well, Marion
had found several directors of health services who, in fact, prescribed even
thought their bosses had told me, “Oh, no.”
Tracy: That’s funny.
Mahoney: [01:13:40] I said, “Marion, how many of these people you talked to have told
their bosses?”
And she said, “Half.” It was maybe three and three she had called. She
had gotten yeses from six. She had called about ten.
Then I called UCLA and I got some guy, a vice president named
Barney something. I don’t remember his last name. He said, “Oh, yes, we
prescribe contraception. You people up there ought to know this. It’s your
state legislator.”
I said, “Our state legislator? What do you mean?”
He said, “John Vasconcellos [John Bernard Vasconcellos],” who
indeed was in the Assembly or the Senate.
We’d already had the San Francisco Summer of Love and all that, and
throughout San Francisco in emergency rooms and in clinics near the Haight,
there would be these spaced-out kids show up on some form of drug and

41

needing medical attention, but they couldn’t be provided because this was a
battery on a runaway or whatever. So Vasconcellos had put through a law in
California that had passed both houses and had been signed by whoever was
the governor. It might have been Jerry Brown. It was: any minor living apart
from home, which UCLA construed to be a dormitory, and managing funds,
regardless of source. So if your grandmother slipped you money or your
mother slipped you money when you were a runaway in the Haight, you were
managing funds regardless of source, including family. Such people can give
consent to medical treatment as if they were adults, and that had become the
law in California.
I called Marion, and I said, “Bingo.”
I remember saying to this fellow Barney, “Is anybody else in the UC
system doing this?”
He said “Berkeley is, but they won’t tell you. Davis is, and they will tell
you.” So I called Davis. So I got confirmation from two UC institutions, and
Marion and I wrote a report to our respective bosses saying, “This is the
deal.”
Glaser approved a policy change at Cowell, which Pitzer did not
change. It was very interesting, but it wouldn’t have happened, I think at the
time, (a), if Smith had not taken the initiative, and then if I hadn’t found the
dean who knew about John Vasconcellos, because when I brought it up and
we talked about it, no one knew about this.
I remember calling Milton Marks, who was a state senator from San
Francisco. He drove every day from San Francisco and back. He had a

42

driver. So he went to bar mitzvahs and he went to funerals, and he knew
everything and everybody, and he’d take your call. So I called and I said, “We
understand John Vasconcellos says that this is the case. Are you able to verify
it?” Because Vasconcellos was known as kind of flakey.
And Marks said, “Oh, yes. Doctors in San Francisco didn’t want young
people dying in the streets, and we needed to do something.” So that’s the
history of that policy change at Stanford, attributed to hippies in San
Francisco.
Tracy: Was there ever any challenge to it?
Mahoney: [01:18:13] No. I think by that time, things had shifted nationally and
otherwise, and people knew that we were no longer in loco parentis, knew
that—I mean, it was just a different time.
During all that time, we were beginning to get—Berkeley had
happened. There’d been issues at Stanford that I don’t think most of the
student body was involved in, most of the student body was not involved in,
but there had been the fire in Sterling’s office and sit-ins here and there.
Then Joel [Joel Pritchard Smith] went off to be president of Denison.
He was succeeded by a man named Peter Buckley, who was a mechanical
engineer on the faculty. So it was the faculty wanting an academic in the
Dean of Students Office. He had a wonderful history in engineering of
working with students, and he was very creative. He was one of the founders
of this so-called Design Division. He wasn’t very articulate. He, for example,
was the person who had been responsible for what everybody on campus
knew in the spring as the Garbage Can Race. Engineers got garbage cans of

43

one kind or another, and they had to float them with them in rowboat style
across Lake Lagunita without sinking. I remember at a staff meeting, when
he first became dean, asking him why? What did this thing do? Why did he
think that was important? I mean, really.
Tracy: It was his thing.
Mahoney: [01:20:43] Right, and he was excited to have done this. This was his claim to
fame. He was the professor of the Garbage Can Race. But he couldn’t say
why.
Then one day we were walking over together for coffee at Tresidder.
He said, “Damn it, Sally. Engineers can’t take risks. You badly design an
airplane wing, and people die. We needed something that not only would be
fun, but had minimal risk for the mechanical engineering design principles
people were pushing the envelope for.”
And I thought, “Oh, you did have a reason.” But he had remembered
that for what had been months after we had the first conversation.
He was very interested in looking at crowds that would be in White
Plaza or headed to the Old Union or whatever and talking about what do
people see? Was the crowd really angry?
One day he came to a staff meeting and he brought several cameras,
and he suggested that when crowds gathered on White Plaza that we go out
into White Plaza and take pictures, and then we’d all come back and talk
about what we saw.
I remember John Hanson, who was associate dean for counseling at
the time and then left to go as dean of students to another institution, he

44

said, “Peter, that’s dangerous. I like Stanford, but I’m not prepared to die for
it.”
And we all kind of went [demonstrates]. He didn’t understand that that
was dangerous. We probably would have survived if we did it, but we just
said we wouldn’t do it.
That was how I got to the Provost’s Office. Peter was going to go
away. He was going to go as president, as a dean, to something in Indiana, to
Bradley, and he was going to go away, but he was going to, quote, “clean
things up” for his successor, whoever that would be.
Tracy: So Peter wasn’t in—how long was Peter in?
Mahoney: [01:23:40] Only a couple of years.
Tracy: Yes. So not very long.
Mahoney: [01:23:42] Not very long.
Then one afternoon I got a call from Dick Lyman’s secretary. He was
provost. She said, “Sally, Mr. Lyman would like to see you this evening if
possible. Can you come over about five o’clock?”
And I said, “Sure.” I put the phone down, and I thought, “I don’t
know Mr. Lyman. What does he want? What should I bring?”
So I called back and I talked to Evelyn, and I said, “Evelyn, you didn’t
say what Mr. Lyman wants to talk about. Is there any material I should
bring?”
She said, “I’ll check.” So she called me back and she said, “No, just
come.”

45

I decided that what was going on was that Peter didn’t want to fire me
before he left because too many people on the faculty liked working with me
and I liked working with them, so he was asking Dick Lyman to do it. So
that’s my mindset when I went to see Dick Lyman.
We sat in those two leather chairs that Dick dragged around the world
that got seedier and seedier, and he began the conversation by saying nice
things and then saying, “You know, I don’t know what you want to do over
time, but does it occur to you that you’re getting to have been a long time in
the Dean of Students Office?” Reinforcement, I’m about to be fired.
I said—I don’t know, hem, haw.
And he said, “So we down here have been talking about you, and there
are changes that we’re going to have to be making because Howard and Ray,
Ray is doing summer session.”
Tracy: Was this Ray Bacchetti?
Mahoney: [01:26:04] Bacchetti. “He’s going to have to move over to work more with
Howard.” And Howard, I didn’t notice at the time, was about to go to be
provost of the several [Claremont] Colleges and then he subsequently
became president of the women’s college, Scripps College.
And he said, “So we need someone to come into the office to be
director of summer session and assistant provost, replacing Ray.”
I didn’t know who Ray was, and I said, “What does Ray do?”
And he said, “Well, he runs summer session and makes sure that the
four schools that have summer session do something, and then he does
whatever the provost needs having done. That’s what you would do.” He

46

paused and he said, “You’re associate dean of students. You wouldn’t be
assistant to the provost; you would be assistant provost.”
And I was supposed to say, “Yes, oh, wonderful,” but I said, “I think
before I say yes, I want to talk to Ray Bacchetti. I don’t want to complain,
but you haven’t been very specific, and I want to know whether I think I can
do this job you want me to do.”
He laughed and he said, “They tell me that you’re very cautious, but
not always.”
And I said, “Well, I’m cautious about building up confidence that I can
do what people want me to do.”
I no sooner had opened the door to my apartment than the phone
rang, and it was Ray Bacchetti, who said, “You didn’t say yes.”
I said, “You know, I’m honored by this confidence that Mr. Lyman
has, but I don’t know what you do. As a matter of fact, I don’t even know
who you are. If I passed you in the hall, I wouldn’t know you.”
He said, “Well, come see me at seven-thirty in the morning,” and so I
did. I told Mr. Lyman I would come. But it was funny how I got to the
Provost’s Office.
Tracy: If you had not taken the position in the Provost’s Office, would you have
been able to maintain—would you have been kept on in dean of students?
Mahoney: [01:28:37] I have no idea. What I do know is that Jim Lyons replaced Peter
Buckley. It was a national search. He was much more a traditional dean of
students than Joel Smith ever was, and I resonated with Joel, and I didn’t

47

know enough about Jim Lyons to have a view of him, and I didn’t have to
have a view of him because I had moved, so it was fine.
But then over time, we had Mr. Pitzer as president, and he was a funny,
charming man that nobody ever saw as funny and charming because they
didn’t know him, and he didn’t last very long. It was a hellish time. By that
time, lots of things were heating up. Over the prior five years we had sit-ins
in the Old Union, and they’d come up to the third floor. They had taken over
a Xerox machine and they had taken over Joel’s office, and we had the police
in. But they were internal issues, a little bit on the war but mostly internal
issues. The admission of—after the assassination of Martin Luther King—
the whole business of students of color, began with African Americans.
Tracy: That’s the well-known event with the Black Student Union interrupting the
memorial on campus.
Mahoney: [01:30:44] Right. Well, it was a meeting of the Academic Council, so all the
faculty was there and Dick was speaking. This kid came from stage left and
took the microphone out of his hand. I still remember Dick just freezing.
And, I don’t know, this kid went on and on.
By this time, we had several [other] things [going on] in the Dean of
Students Office. One, Bill somebody or other, [Leland] because of Vietnam,
had become a counselor to students who wanted to conscientious objectors.
He had a big entourage. I was in the Dean of Students Office. Bill [a
different Bill], every time the draft would want him, went on an eating binge
and became too fat. Literally, that’s how he kept himself out, because he

48

didn’t want to go. Peoria, Illinois, would never have understood if Bill
became a C.O. So he simply became unfit.
Everybody at Stanford was loaded into San Jose’s draft board, and Bill
[Leland], who had been director of the Stern complex, was working with the
faculty there, was really a very able counselor, and he saw that every student
at Stanford went to San Jose. So it got so mucked up with so many people,
most of whom didn’t live except temporarily in San Jose, but they didn’t
know what to do, so nobody paid any attention. They either got C.O. status
or they got strung out long enough for the draft to be over. It didn’t matter
much. They just didn’t go.
At the time we started to look for African American students and then
American Indian students and then Hispanics students, whom we called
Chicano at the time. There was some kind of to-do. We had hired a guy
named Jim Simmons. I don’t quite know who hired him, but he was the
special assistant to the president for African American affairs.
After one of these altercations, sit-ins, they were still sitting-in, but they
were going off to an office to decide what to do. One of the issues was to
bring an end to the legacy preference of children of Stanford alums, which
was never very much of a preference, nothing like the preference at
Princeton or at Yale. Also until well into the sixties, we barely had enough
male applicants to make a class. We had too many women but not enough
men. So our view had to be of men up in the 75 to 80 percent range, and
there was all this to-do about legacies.

49

Then they went off, and Jim Simmons came back the next morning
and said, “They are withdrawing their demand that we give up the legacy
preference.”
I remember somebody saying to him, “How did that get
accomplished?”
And he said, “Somebody in the room said, ‘Twenty-five years from
now, our kids will have preference.’’ Took it off the table. Some of them later
became trustees. Charles Ogletree is a professor of law at Harvard. I mean,
these people were smart.
But all of that was going on, and Dick was really left holding the bag in
terrible ways. I remember Lyle Nelson was director of campus
communication or whatever it was called, the vice president for public
affairs, and Bob Byers was his new service person. Bob had been around a
long time, started Campus Report, started the Observer, kept saying, “Stanford
has to tell the truth. That’s the easiest way to get through the troubles. We
have to tell what’s true,” would not allow Campus Report or the Observer to be
edited by the administration.
From time to time, I think where the leadership group came to realize
that they didn’t know what to do about Pitzer. There was some sit-in, and
Pitzer had been in the East. I don’t know whether it was weather or
whatever, he didn’t get back on time, and they didn’t want to call the police
without Pitzer. Well, he never showed up that night. So it was Dick who
had to call the police to clear whatever. It was probably the Old Union.

50

Then the next day or two, it was discovered that Pitzer had come home
and had not come down to campus. I just remember nobody wanted to talk
about it. Nobody. Pitzer went out of his way to thank Dick and to say, “You
did exactly the right thing,” but it was a moment in which when you call the
cops, you lose control.
We were lucky. We weren’t Berkeley. We didn’t have Ed Meese as our
district attorney and the sheriff who worked with Ed Meese with teargas on
campus. Our D.A. and our sheriff understood that our kids were going to be
leaders when they grew up, and this was something that they would have to
get through. So it was done, but it was done carefully, but, nevertheless,
because you never know what will get out of control.
So then Pitzer thought about resigning, and the word was that he
would or he wouldn’t, and he couldn’t make up his mind. Lyle Nelson went
up to the house. The story we heard from Bob Byers. Finally, Pitzer had
written out a letter of resignation or maybe typed it out, I don’t know, but it
was unsigned. Lyle must have sat with him for quite a while and said, “Do
you think it’s time for you to sign this?”
He said, “Yes,” and he signed it.
Lyle picked it up, went to the front door of Hoover House, and handed
it to Bob Byers, who was standing in the entryway, and Bob Byers gave it to
the press. That was the announcement that Pitzer had resigned. How the
board worked on that, I don’t know, but very quickly Dick got made
president and Bill Miller came in.

51

But those were very difficult times. I came into the Provost’s Office
because Ray had to work on finance, and that was the first downsizing. That
was the Budget Adjustment Program, followed by the Budget Equilibrium
Program three or four years later. So in all this turmoil, we also had to think
about tuition. We had to think about expenditure levels. SES had said you’ve
got to pay attention to undergraduates. As we enrolled more students who
didn’t look like the “typical” Stanford student, we needed resources to
support them while we were working on getting African Americans.
The other thing, and I don’t quite know why, a fellow named Doug
Davis was very interested in American Indians, and he pulled a group of us
together to recruit American Indians that we didn’t know anything about.
One of the physicians at the Health Service, who subsequently became
director after Mac Osborne left, and Doug somehow knew, and one of the
faculty in the English department had worked as a conscientious objector, he
had been assigned to the Navajo Nation to work with Indians. That was the
Second World War conscientious objectors. Virgil Whitaker was his name.
We started calling around to schools on reservations and the boarding
schools, and then we found in Alaska Jesuits who ran schools for the
Indians. Then we realized that Bob North’s wife was American Indian and
that he had contacts in the Navajo Nation and that Virgil Whitaker had as
one of his own students, Scott Momaday, who was Navajo and who had
done a PhD at Stanford [with Ivor Winters].
So we proceeded to get on the phone and bring American Indians to
Stanford. We were unprepared and they were unprepared. It took Dick

52

Lyman and most of Don Kennedy’s tenure before we had a hundred,
because every one of them needed to be mentored one-on-one. But Dick
managed to get those kinds of things done at the same time he was putting
out fires.
I said earlier that Stanford’s issues were internal. They were about two
things: they were about secret research and they were about ROTC. The
reason SES structure for the faculty changed was, again, Memorial
Auditorium. The faculty as a whole had to vote on academic policy. So if
there was to be an end to secret research, the faculty as a whole had to vote.
If there was to be an end to credit for ROTC, not the end of ROTC, the end
of credit for ROTC, it had to be done in a committee of the whole faculty at
Memorial Hall.
Committees made proposals, proposals were heard, various people got
up and said various things. I remember Ron Rebholz [Ronald A. Rebholz]
talking about credit and all of this. But then the vote was a roll-call vote, not
by rank but by alphabet, Adams to Zilch. It meant that assistant professors in
some departments voted before their senior colleagues, who would decide
their tenure. And it was awful.
I remember coming back from the Academic Council vote on secret
research, which really affected the science and engineering faculty and it
affected our role with the Stanford Research Institute. People saying, “Never
again. We have to find another way.” And Herb Packer gave us the other
way. It’s interesting to me—I read this the other night—how amazingly
unchanged it has been for forty years.

53

But all of that got done, and I’m the junior person in the pecking order.
Summer session was fine. I enjoyed it. Dick said to me, when he offered me
the job, he said, “I have talked with the four associate deans who will be your
partners in the summer session side of this, and they all think that’s OK.”
Like, why wouldn’t it be? Well, one of those four associate deans was a
Mormon bishop who wasn’t all sure that a woman should have this job.
Tracy: Oh, boy.
Mahoney: [01:45:58] [But she turned out to be] absolutely elegant and polite and
helpful. Then a man in political science, James T. Watkins, who was not
known as favoring women students, sent me this lovely note that said, “I
look forward to teaching in your first summer session. James T. Watkins IV.”
I thought, “God.” People saw it as a much bigger deal than I did, and
as some people saw it, Dick was much more brave than I had thought. I just
wondered, you know, could I do the job.
Then those first years, half the job was summer session and half the job
was doing whatever the provost wanted me to do.

STANFORD STAFF ORAL HISTORY PROJECT

INTERVIEWER:

ALLISON TRACY

INTERVIEWEE:

SALLY T. MAHONEY

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

FEBRUARY 26, 2014

Tracy: Hi. This is Allison Tracy. It is February 26, 2014. I’m here with Sally
Mahoney to conduct our second session of our oral history interviews for the
Stanford Historical Society.
So, Sally, to start out, I wanted to go back to a couple questions I had
from our first session. This first question is maybe sort of an inconsequential
bit of information, but I was really curious. We’d spoken about Lucille Allen
and sort of what had happened with her in her position, but I was wondering
if there’s ever any conversations or inklings or anything that her position
would be eliminated before sort of what unfolded that led to her being asked
to leave. Because when she was asked to leave, they sort of went ahead and
eliminated that position. I just was curious if that was on the horizon.
Mahoney: [00:00:56] I was simply too junior to know anything about that, but it was
very clear that the university acted very quickly—Bob Wert, Bob Hind, Joel
Smith, Herb Packer, Dick Lyman—to see to it something else put in place,
that it was time for functional assignments rather than gender-based
assignments, although there was, after she left, nevertheless, they were

55

functional assignments, but there was always in that first year or two a man
and a woman sharing the responsibility.
Tracy: Interesting. And that slowly worked its way out of the system.
Mahoney: [00:01:52] Right.
Tracy: Interesting.
Mahoney: [00:01:54] Right. But I remember when Don Winbigler [Hugh Donald
Winbigler] asked me to go from Branner to Roble, at the end of the year I
was at Branner, my first year in residence as a director. It was also the year of
the Mississippi Summer, and I had R.A.s who went to Mississippi, as I
mentioned the last time, and so there was a lot happening in the broader
world. But what might have been happening in the context of Stanford, I had
no idea. And I was rather surprised when he said to me, “I want you to go to
Roble because so many Stanford women alumnae have lived at Roble,”
because Branner came along, I guess, only after the Second World War, and
that I was suddenly the most senior woman in the system was just
implausible to me. And they brought people in, some of whom stayed, some
of whom did not stay.
Tracy: Interesting. We’re jumping ahead in the timeline of what I’m going to ask,
but I sort of see it as a part of this same evolution. I’m wondering about
beyond the co-ed dorms or sort of the integration of men and women in the
dorms and beyond your work in eliminating the parietal rules, how did
Stanford’s shift towards becoming truly coeducational and what other ways
did you see that manifesting at that time, if there were other sort of notable

56

ways? Because it seems that a lot of this falls into maybe this broader shift
of—
Mahoney: [00:03:51] Well, a lot was going on around the country. I can’t remember
whether I mentioned to you that when Princeton was considering going coed, I went to Princeton. Yale was wrestling with that at the same time. At
Harvard, Pusey’s gauntlet was, “There will be no co-residence,” meaning
coeducational residences, “without a single corporation.” So all around the
country in elite universities, these things were going on.
The element that seemed important at Stanford at the time, and for this
reason and others, the fifties may have been more important than the boring
time that most people think it was, because the fifties started, with a German
Studies professor, the Overseas Studies Program, and I would say that the
idea of faculty living in residence with students, and in some cases engaging
in formal academic work, in other cases in informal work, was characteristic
of that time and very different from the sense that faculty had of their
colleagues who worked with students in Student Services, who were people
who kept order and peace and whatever.
So people in those roles came to see themselves as partners with faculty
in the education of students. That was important, and it was articulated in
SES somewhat later than Lucille Allen, but that was where we were moving
to, and that was bringing us into the general environment that people talked
about when they talked about the Harvard houses or the Yale colleges, that
merger of academic and intellectual life in the non-classroom setting. That
was important for us. But I can’t think of anything else. The gender issues

57

per se, we talked about the Health Service and contraceptive. It’s just all of
the piece, I think.
Did we talk about closing down the Counseling Center and merging it
into Cowell?
Tracy: Let’s talk about it for a couple of minutes, because I don’t think we did, went
into it in any detail.
Mahoney: [00:07:28] In the same period of time that I was working with Marion
Shikamura to deal with the Health Service issues, there was increasing
concern that we had redundancy of psychological services. We had a Health
Service that was getting much more sophisticated about student health and
that focused on post-adolescent student health, came to have more of a
psychiatric staff component than it might have had earlier.
Then the question arose, why do we have psychiatric services one place
for students and psychological services another place for students? Jack
Black, who was a very well-regarded psychologist, headed the Counseling and
Testing Service, as it was called, located on the third floor of the Old Union,
down the hall from the dean of students.
So Joel Smith asked me to take a look at that, which was really treading
on very thin ice, because the psychologists talked about what they did as
being about student health and what psychiatrists did was being about
student illness, that kind of dichotomy. I talked to some of the deans, I
talked to the law school dean. I was asked to talk to a couple of students by
the associate dean, Keith Mann [J. Keith Mann], and I did.

58

You may remember that someone ran for vice president on
McGovern’s ticket, a man who was a senator from Missouri, and it came up
in the middle of that campaign that he had had psychiatric treatment.
Tracy: That he’d actually had stays, multiple overnight stays in—
Mahoney: [00:09:47] In psychiatric facilities. And that created chaos in that campaign.
Law students talked about how that, if known, would be held against them if
they used a psychiatrist, so they used, they said, the Counseling and Testing
Center, even when those psychologists felt they needed a psychiatrist and
would refer them off campus because they didn’t want a university record.
That was wholly new to me, but we teased it apart, and we heightened the
awareness of confidentiality and all the rest of it.
Joel took the decision to close the Counseling and Testing Center. A
couple of those staff members went over to Cowell, and others left the
university. But it was making Cowell and indeed another set of services at
Stanford more sophisticated, more intellectually “with it” than the system
had been heretofore. So there were lots of those kinds of changes going on
so that faculty could have greater confidence in the services being provided.
That’s all I remember about it.
Tracy: You brought up the SES, the Study of Education at Stanford, and one
question that I had going back to that was in a broader sense, do you
remember—you were involved more explicitly in the residential education
portion of it.
Mahoney: [00:11:42] Sure.

59

Tracy: But I’m wondering in a broader sense how SES changed Stanford’s
approach.
Mahoney: [00:11:51] In two ways. One, one of the committees that I only observed and
read their report produced a faculty governance structure that we still use,
and [two] SES recommendations from several of the committees became the
agenda of the standing committees of the faculty when they started to
meet—the Committee on Undergraduate Studies, the Committee on
Admission and Financial Aid—and, indeed, some of the members of each of
those SES committees wound up being the chair or the member of those
new Senate committees. So there was real continuity out of SES into the
faculty governance structure along several lines, certainly Admission and
Financial Aid, Undergraduate Studies, which was a new office and a new
committee.
The report on graduate education didn’t have the heft it needed to
have. There was extracted from it by Alberta Siegel, who was a professor of
psychology in the Department of Psychiatry in the School of Medicine—she
was an Advisory Board member; she was a very influential woman faculty
member—she extracted a piece that became a separate monograph, which
was about women graduate students, their paltry numbers, what services they
did or didn’t have, how they were treated in departments, what the issues
were going forward that the university really needed to attend to. All of that
resulted in—it must have been Lincoln Moses as dean replacing the English
professor who had been graduate dean for many years.

60

There was another study of graduate education that produced much
more focused recommendations two or three years later, but there is no
question but that SES gave us a structure for faculty governance and gave
committees having to do with undergraduates—including Overseas Studies
was another one of those—their agenda going forward and their personnel in
the first few years of transition.
So I think SES, from the point of view of undergraduate education,
was pretty powerful, and it did not have the shortcomings of the typical
study where people are thanked for their participation and their report filed
away, so I think. And also the case that in Bob Wert, [a Vice-Provost for
Undergraduate Education at the time] who left the university to president of
Mills College, but he was concerned with undergraduate education [and the
new deanship]; Joel Smith passing that baton forward; the replacement of
Rick Snyder with Fred Hargadon, all of those responded at the staffing level
to the recommendations of SES.
Tracy: Interesting.
Mahoney: [00:15:39] So, yes, I think it was pretty powerful.
Tracy: Did SES formalize a level of faculty involvement in concerns about
undergraduate education that already existed, or did it create new sites of
faculty involvement, or neither or both?
Mahoney: [00:16:03] As the faculty grew with far more high-powered scholars,
researchers, with a need to mentor graduate students, I think the concern was
that the faculty who had preceded that growth, who had been very focused
on undergraduate education, would still continue that, but that the new

61

people wouldn’t be drawn into it. So the committee structures that had
existed were more refined coming out of SES, and so there came to be real
faculty venues at the committee level and then at the policy level with Senate
decisions with respect to their recommendations that focused on.
When you think of the number of committees that by the seventies
were reporting to the Senate, a substantial portion of them were
undergraduate Senate committees. There was the Committee on Research
and there was the Committee on Graduate Studies, but still. And then there
came to be the equivalent later of the Committee on Professoriate, which
was very important as we moved along. That came in Bill Miller’s
provostship.
Tracy: When you think back on your time in dean of students, what did you gain
from it and how did it benefit you then moving forward to the other
positions that you assumed?
Mahoney: [00:18:24] In part because of Joel Smith’s encouragement and my kind of
staffing outreach to a variety of things, I became much more aware of the
university as an organization and appreciative of its interdependent parts, and
I came to have an ease about picking up the phone and calling people. That
was enormously helpful. And I learned how to say no gracefully.
Joel Smith left to become president at Dennison in Ohio, and he had
been an undergraduate at Oberlin. He was replaced, and it was interesting,
the replacement was a faculty member from engineering, mechanical
engineering, design division, Peter Buckley, who didn’t stay very long and
who went to Bradley University also in the Midwest. Peter had a heart in the

62

right place, but not very good sense of students who weren’t engineers, and I
don’t think an appreciation of faculty who weren’t engineers. He would have
proposals that seemed off the wall.
By that time, we were having protests, and we had a sit-in in the Old
Union before Joel left, because I remember one of the things we learned
from that was to turn off the capacity of those phones to engage in longdistance calls if a sit-in occurred, because people used those phones to make
long-distance calls to their mothers, their grandmothers, all sorts of people.
So one of the little procedures we learned from that event was turn off the
phones.
Tracy: That’s funny.
Mahoney: [00:21:18] And around the country, people were learning the same things.
But the war was an issue, and it became more and more of an issue, and we
had the takeover of the Engineering Building where H. Bruce Franklin,
professor of English, was involved. And Peter—if I’ve told you this, stop
me. Peter, for all his good intentions, wanted us to sit down and talk about
where were these kids and what were we not paying attention to, and his idea
about how to do that was to give us cameras and take us out to White Plaza.
This was nuts.
And I think a variety of people I knew in the university knew that I
wasn’t enamored of this. And so then Dick Lyman appeared and I went to
the Provost’s Office to do whatever the provost told me to do half-time, and
to do summer session the other half-time.

63

Tracy: So let’s go ahead and then shift over to your time in the Provost’s Office. We
talked a little bit last time about your time overseeing the summer session,
and it sounds like even with the dean of students it was another good lesson
in sort of—
Mahoney: [00:22:58] Oh, it was. It gave me a pot of money to spend with the associate
deans in four schools who had summer session programs and with the
Student Affairs people, and it gave me a basis for sitting down with the
people who were trying to make money, the conference program, and say,
“That’s really OK. You can make money as long as we have enough space to
house students. They come first.”
And I got more involved with the Controller’s Office in finance,
because I had a budget. I remember the controller once complaining to Dick
Lyman that I had allowed people to register without paying, and it had been a
300 percent increase in deadbeats since the prior summer when I wasn’t in
charge, when Ray was in charge. And I pondered that and I looked into it,
and I came back and I said at a meeting where both Dick and Ken Creighton
[Kenneth Creighton], the then-controller was, that it was true it was 300
percent. It was $900 to $2,700, and since we were talking about several
million, I thought it was important to try to get every penny we could, but I
hoped I could be forgiven if I didn’t think it was the most important thing
that I needed to worry about. Creighton looked very unhappy, and Dick tried
not to laugh.
But, you know, the three schools that didn’t do summer session, or did
it in their own terms, business, which had those huge conferences that made

64

the money, the law school where nothing went on because people had other
things to do, and the medical school which had all sorts of things going on,
new interns and new residents and everything else, but the four other schools
had pretty serious programs. And it gave me an appreciation through the
associate deans, who were the finance officers in each of the four schools,
how their deans thought about the curriculum, thought about tradeoffs,
thought about enrollments. I got lessons in the priorities of the academic side
of the institution by working with those four associate deans and an
occasional meeting with the deans themselves, and I couldn’t have done that
without that summer session experience.
I remember one day I wanted to do something and I thought it would
produce money, but I had no line-item budget for it. I went to Ray to get his
advice, and he said, “Oh, this is how you do it. It’s a good idea.” I don’t
remember what it was. But he said, “You put it in your budget as expenditure
in anticipation of income.” I’d never heard the phrase. It set me up to do
other things. You had to be accountable, but still it gave me a sense of what
to do. So I learned a lot from that and it gave me a sense of the appointment
process, faculty appointment process, all the things that I otherwise learned
how to deal with later. But it was a terrific opportunity, and it was everybody.
It was the police, it was the fire department. So I just sort of ran my little
place. Ray told me that would be the case, and he was right. So that’s that
story.

65

Tracy: During this time—and I assume that this would have fallen under your other
half-time responsibilities as an assistant provost—you did a review of the
Registrar’s Office. Is that right?
Mahoney: [00:27:59] I did that towards the end. There were two things in the Provost’s
Office that people hoped the newcomer would take on. One was parking,
and I avoided that, and the other was women’s physical education and the
need over time to merge the departments, and I think we’ve talked about
that.
Tracy: You know, I don’t know that we actually have. You and I have spoken about
that separately, but I don’t know that we’ve spent much time on it in an
interview, and it was something I wanted to cover, so let’s go ahead and talk
about that.
Mahoney: [00:28:49] That was my first provost staff assignment, and it had been in the
portfolio of Howard Brooks [E. Howard Brooks], who had been vice
provost on the academic side of things. Howard, a few years later, went off
to be provost of the Claremont Colleges and then became president of
Scripps College, the women’s college there. He said, “The provost and the
provost staff and the Advisory Board have all talked about the need to stop
making tenure-ladder appointment in women’s physical education.”
There had been one tenure-ladder appointment in what once upon a
time must have been men’s physical education, but everybody who had a
serious appointment in women’s P.E. was on faculty. And he said, “This has
to stop. They’re not faculty. They don’t do research. There is no graduate
program. The School of Education has abandoned serial P.E. as a major.”

66

They dropped the baccalaureate. Pamela Strathairn’s [Pamela Lei Strathairn]’s
history was the history of P.E. They abandoned the undergraduate program.
They abandoned the master’s program. They abandoned the doctoral
program.
[telephone interruption]
Mahoney: [00:30:38] Three of her degrees were in P.E. from Stanford, and by the time I
arrived on the scene, the School of Education had stopped offering those
degrees, so there really was no need for a faculty. And Howard said, “I’ve
been working with them for well over a year, and I can’t get them to
understand.” That turned out to be the key to my moving forward. I would
go and visit Pam Strathairn, who was a remarkable woman, and her faculty,
and we would talk about the provost’s view of the department.
One afternoon I had an epiphany, and it’s kind of interesting what
tracks. In an academic institution, when you deal with people you respect,
their response that they don’t understand challenges you to make the case
better. I’m sure it was an honest response, but it was really a response that
said this can’t be happening. It wasn’t that they didn’t understand; it was they
didn’t want it to happen. And not understanding came to be their defense.
And neither Howard nor Ray could get past that.
So I went back one afternoon, and I said, “Pam, it’s going to happen,
so let’s talk about the alternatives. Do you want them called teaching staff?
That’s what they’re going to be. They’re going to be like lecturers.”
She said, “They can’t be lecturers. They don’t lecture.”

67

So we conjured up this set of titles, teaching associate and senior
teaching associate, and so that’s what they were called. Only one of them was
still in the tenure ladder. And they were developing dance, and we were
putting drama out of business, the speech component of the speech and
drama department out of business, which I had nothing to do with. Over
time, dance moved into drama.
But there was that component. Once we got past the “We don’t
understand,” and I remember going down to Howie’s office and saying, “I
think I’ve got it.” Because nobody was going to reduce their salaries. They
just couldn’t be in the tenure ladder, which is not a small thing. And I said, “I
think we have a new set of titles.” He looked at me, and I said, “Teaching
associate and senior teaching associate. They can’t be lecturers,” because
that’s what people had been saying they would be. I said, “I think it’s more
important to give way on that title, which is just made up out of whole cloth,
than it is to still argue about the tenure ladder. If this is the price of ending
the tenure ladder, it’s a small price.” So we took it to Dick, and Dick agreed
and it was done.
At about the same time, we knew that we were going to have to merge
the departments, and it meant Title IX was coming along, had been
articulated, but the regs were not yet in place. That took three years, Richard
Nixon’s presidency. We had a situation in which women’s lifeguards in
women’s P.E. got x salary, and male lifeguards in the athletic department got
x + y salary. I said Pam, “We’re not going to reduce those salaries. You have
to come up.”

68

And she said, “Then I have to close the pool. I have to reduce the
hours by,” I think she said, by a third on the Roble campus.
And I said, “Oh.” And I went back to the Provost’s Office and I said,
“I need more money. Pam will do this. She doesn’t begrudge students a
proper wage, but she doesn’t have any money, so her choices are close the
pool and raise the salaries or don’t raise the salaries and have pool hours.
And the third alternative is to give her enough money to make her pool
hours whole.” So we did that.
So we began to do things that made them feel valued, and so they gave
up their anguish about not being in the tenure ladder, and they began to
realize that there would be opportunities for Stanford women in what was
going to inevitably happen that they had never been able to persuade anyone
to provide. So I think in the end they were very grateful.
I think offline I had mentioned to you that I had seen the Stanford
magazine article that Gary Cavalli had done about women’s sports, and it was
a good article, but it started where Gary started. And they had done things
earlier on. The Stanford Block S Society had always been male. Pam and her
colleagues went back over thirty years of women athletes and said, “If we
applied the Block S rules, which of these women would get Block S awards?”
And they named them, they had an event, those women came to the event. I
knew someone who would have graduated in the middle sixties who came to
the event and said that people wept, that they couldn’t believe this was
happening.

69

So the eventual merger of the two departments was seen by the
women’s department, in the end, as a great opportunity. It took a while and
different personnel for men to see that, and the university did a very good
job of finding new personnel. Pam took a lot of heat from the women’s
sports organization.
Tracy: AIAW?
Mahoney: [00:39:07] Correct. Because at their meeting, she announced the withdrawal
of Stanford from the organization and our intention to join this merged
NCAA. She had people sending her vitriolic messages and shouting at her.
Andy Geiger, who by then was A.D., and he had been preceded by Joe Ruetz
[Joseph Hubert Ruetz], an old Notre Dame football player who had been a
Stanford development officer, but really cared about these things and he
knew how to deal with the Buck Club people, the men who gave money to
the men’s department.
Tracy: The boosters, yes.
Mahoney: [00:0:02] The boosters. He knew how to deal with things that nobody else
would have, and so he worked. Pam had very high regard for him, and so she
and the department were ready when NCAA said, “The time has come.”
Geiger, it was his vote. He represented Stanford, and he stood up and
said, “This vote will be cast by Pam.” And she was honored. It was the right
thing to do, but in that environment—I wasn’t there, but in that
environment it would have been quite unusual. So that was my little
contribution to the activity.

70

Tracy: Do you have any memory, besides sort of the initial groundwork that you
had laid by getting more funds so they could staff it, comparable wage levels,
even though you wouldn’t necessarily have been that involved per se, did you
have a sense that more monies needed to go into athletics as a whole to sort
of properly merge women’s athletics and men’s?
Mahoney: [00:41:24] I was on the search committee that brought in Geiger to Stanford.
I was the provost’s representative. So was Pat Devaney [Patricia L. Devaney]
on that committee, and she was on the committee because she understood
athletics through her father, who was the very famous Devaney at Nebraska.
He’d been football coach and then A.D. In fact, he came out and talked to
us.
When Al Hastorf was on that committee, it was chaired by an alumnus
who had been head of the Stanford Booster Club or the Stanford something,
Frank Lodado, who later was a trustee, or maybe he was then a trustee. We
had no candidates, we only had consultants, because athletics is all about
loyalty and the opposite is treachery, so if you go and you talk to somebody
about a job, that’s treachery. It was very strange. So we only had consultants.
And people made absolutely clear that if word got out that they were a
candidate, they would immediately withdraw. So Lodado was doing
preliminary interviews with people in bars and airports.
Tracy: It had to be that secretive?
Mahoney: [00:42:52] It was very strange. I mean, I had never encountered anything like
this. Geiger walked in, and Al Hastorf always asked the first question of all
the consultants we had, and it was, “What is your philosophy of athletics?”

71

We had heard some very strange responses to that, including from a man
who later became head of the NCAA. And Geiger said, “Athletics for all paid
for by football,” one sentence.
And I said to myself, “I don’t know what following up on his
references or anything else will establish, but we have a viable candidate in
the room.” He’d not been a major sport athlete as an undergraduate. He had
been, I think, a rower at Brown. [Tracy laughs.] But he had very good A.D.
experience. He came to us from Penn, and what’s important about Penn is
that the professional football team in Philadelphia plays in the Penn stadium,
so he knew not only college athletics—and he was also on the NCAA
Television Rights Committee.
Tracy: Which was a very—at least what would have been at that time a really
important committee to be on.
Mahoney: [00:44:35] Yes, and it would be to this day.
Tracy: Yes.
Mahoney: [00:44:38] So he knew the professional side, he knew the money side from
the stadium as well as his own program, and he knew that big picture of how
individual schools make money off the media, etc. He had a very nice touch.
He was willing to say, “If you want to tell people I’m a candidate, it’s all
right.” He just had a different view entirely.
He and his wife moved into a resident fellow’s cottage up on a lake, so
that they lived with students as well as he headed the department. And he
meant athletics were for all paid for by football, so he spent a lot of time
saying to Pam, “What maintenance does your facility need? Are we paying

72

the staff?” I had tried to look; he immediately looked at salary equity. He
immediately looked at why do men—forget football for a moment, but why
do men in volleyball or basketball have better trainers than the women have.
And, yes, we all knew that those things would cost us money, but he also
knew how to get it done and he also knew how to handle money. So I didn’t
pay much attention to his department and its money after these other things
were done; Ray did more of that on the budget side.
But he was a gift to us in bringing things together and showing respect
to people who had been around a long time without at all saying things have
to be the same as they were. They don’t. And he took on fundraising and the
Buck Club and all those things in a very orderly way. So that was a good
thing.
Tracy: Interesting. Anything else in terms of the work that you’ve done with us,
athletics, as a provost?
Mahoney: [00:47:39] No.
Tracy: Assistant provost?
Mahoney: [00:47:40] My next career spent some time doing something would have been
the Committee on Professoriate and then later what the Registrar’s Office
needed in a registrar.
Tracy: Was there anything significant that came out of your work on the Committee
on the Professoriate?
Mahoney: [00:48:10] Wow. [Tracy laughs.] I learned a lot. One of the things I learned
from Bill Miller was keep it simple, have some small number of principles,
and make sure that you apply them consistently and call on them when

73

you’re making decisions. In particular, women who were not on the faculty
who were research associates and lecturers, but particularly in the sciences
where they were research associates, wanted to be principal investigators
[PI’s]. The general rule was subject to exception, but the general rule was
only faculty will be principal investigators.
So part of the issue on the Committee on the Professoriate was who
was a faculty member, and into the middle of all this came these women who
were claiming discrimination because they weren’t allowed to be principal
investigators, and faculty colleagues saying to the deans and the provost,
“Look, these women have conceived these hypotheses and these research
protocols. They are not ancillary to things that we do, and they should be
recognized. They should take responsibility for the funding that comes in. So
you need to make these research associates—.” Maybe also—I can’t
remember whether we also had the title senior research associates. “Give
them faculty privileges with respect to being P.I.’s.”
The Bill Miller principle that Colin Pittendrigh, who chaired that
committee, espoused was, “No. If you do that, you’re a faculty member and
you should have a faculty title.” So Bill asked for a review of every woman in
those lines--who should be brought into the faculty?
I remember a woman in the medical school, who shortly after being
made a full professor died of a brain tumor. I can’t remember her name. But
people were stunned, because what they weren’t pushing to have faculty
titles; they were pushing to have faculty privileges. And Miller and then the
Committee on the Professoriate, which I staffed for Miller with the

74

assistance of my assistant, Susan Horst, said, “No. If they’re faculty
members, we ought to call them faculty members.” And that’s what
happened.
Tracy: That’s interesting.
Mahoney: [00:51:59] But what I took out of that was keep it simple. All around the
country, research people were getting faculty privileges, and then did they
have tenure, did they not have tenure? All that stuff. Bill and Pittendrigh and
the Committee on the Professoriate found a path through that and then a
review that took seriously everybody whose complaint ought to be taken
seriously.
We’d already, on the non-science, non-engineering side run into the
obstacle of the woman lecturer who’s a lecturer because her spouse was a
faculty member. In Dick Lyman’s period as provost, he got an angry letter
from a faculty member in medicine who said, “My colleagues have just done
a national search, and they have come up with a stellar candidate that we find
we can’t appoint because she’s my wife. There is something wrong with this.”
Lyman put Lowell Price on that little investigation, and Lowell went
through history and found two things. One, it had never been written down as
a policy; it was custom. And, two, it had been breached once when Professor
Flügge and Professor Flügge-Lotz in Aeronautics and Astronautics were
together in the department, she with the lower title. The German scientific
community and the German government were about to give her some really
important prize, and it was unthinkable that she go to Germany to collect this
prize if she were not a professor, you know, Herr Doktor Professor, that

75

culture, and she wasn’t. So Fred Terman had said, “We will make an exception
to our understanding about nepotism for this woman, and if the same thing
ever happens again, we’ll do it again, but otherwise the answer’s no.” So,
Flügge and Flügge-Lotz. He was still around when I was first in the Provost’s
Office. Maybe she was. I just don’t know.
But what Lyman found out was we had no written policy and we’d had
an exception, and so he took advantage of that. Then as he became president
and the Committee on the Professoriate came along with Miller, a serious
review of women in the Humanities was done, who had been lecturers: Barbara
Gelpi, somebody else in English. People looked at—oh, Herb Packer’s wife.
Tracy: Nancy.
Mahoney: [00:55:51] Nancy. Though that wasn’t [departmental] nepotism, but that was,
“She can be a lecturer,” kind of thing.
And people kept saying, “Well, if she will have to direct the program,
then we really can’t have a lecturer directing the program,” so they rethought
that.
But those things happened in that period of time, and I came away with
a very strong sense that I used when I went to Agnes Scott, which was
having a different state of affairs, but I would articulate these principles I had
learned at Stanford: keep it simple, and then when issues arise, judge people
vis-à-vis the standards you have for whatever your principles tell you where
the standards are. So it was a very useful time.
Then along came the registrar was approaching retirement. He said to
Bill, “You know, I’m going to be sixty-five.” He had a campus home on

76

Foothill, and he moved to the rentals on Sand Hill Road, Oak Creek, because
there were no condominiums yet, and when they were built, he moved into
those. But he said, “You need to think about the future.”
So Bill came to me, and I did what became my pattern over time,
looking at a situation, researching it, and doing a white paper. That’s what I
had done in the Dean of Student’s Office, at Cowell Student Health Service,
or the Counseling Center. That’s what I basically did with women’s physical
education, kind of get it all together, think about it, because one of the rules I
learned from Bill is you bring your bosses a solution, not a problem. If you
have a proposed solution, make a recommendation, because the last thing
your boss wants from your hard work is another problem. [Tracy laughs.]
So I looked into what the Registrar’s Office was, what the deans
wanted in the registrar, where it was going to go over the next few years, and
I did a white paper, and one of the things I said was that computing was
going to be much more an issue for the office and for the university. Bill
didn’t need to be told that; he was a computer scientist.
Harvey Hall had the highest regard from faculty as a person of
integrity. I learned by looking at the office that that job, although in terms of
volume of activity, it dealt with students, but it was really a Faculty’s Services
Office. The registrar needed to be able to assure the faculty that their policies
as regards to students were being followed and that exceptions were not sort
of willy-nilly and that exceptions that were serious should be brought to the
Faculty Committee and etc.

77

So I did a white paper, and the next thing that happened was Bill said,
“I think we should go with this.” And I had also said, not in writing, but I
had said to Bill that I knew that Harvey wanted his associate registrar to have
a shot at the job and wanted him to have it. He was a Stanford alum who had
a Harvard MBA, and in terms of the old office was a really fine person, but I
didn’t think could do the big-picture job.
So Bill put together a search committee chaired by Fred Crawford
[Frederic Crawford] in electrical engineering, and the usual array of people,
students and someone from computing. I was Bill’s representative to the
committee and I got someone to staff it. We had people come in from all
over the country. We did interview Bob, as I remember, and we gave Bill our
first choice and two others. He took about a week, and he called me and
Fred into his office.
Tracy: Fred? Fred Hargadon?
Mahoney: [01:01:42] No, Fred Crawford, the professor of electrical engineering, Dean
of Research.
All this year, Harvey had [been] retired, so Bob had been in charge, and
Bill was sad to tell us, that our search had not yielded a registrar. He didn’t
find our A-1 candidate or the other two appointable. I looked at Fred, and
we asked about why. He told us why, and I had to confess that I didn’t
disagree. So I guess I said, “Well, we’re going to have to do a different kind
of search with a different set of emphases, but we’re going to need to take a
little bit of time to do it, because we’ve fished in the pond, and so we can’t
just reopen the search and get the same people to apply.”

78

So we waited for a while, and then nothing happened, nothing
happened, nothing happened. And we were headed for summer into fall, and
I went to Bill one day and I said, “Bill, we can’t ask Bob Houghton [Robert
Douglas Houghton] to do this job a second year and not give it to him, and
you and I know and Fred knows that he shouldn’t do it, but this is unfair.”
He looked at me, smiling, and said, “I have a solution.”
And I said, “Well, then, for goodness sake, execute it.” [Tracy laughs.]
And he said, “You’ll do it.”
And my first answer was, “I will not.” So we talked a while, and we
agreed that I would stay in the Provost’s Office and do the Registrar’s Office
not exactly half-time, but I would do the Registrar’s Office, and I would do
stuff in the Provost’s Office, so that’s what happened. That’s how I got
there. I said I wouldn’t do it.
In addition to having simple principles about topics people think are
just so complicated that they have to have complicated solutions, Bill’s other
great skill was to identify people who could do certain jobs. Chuck Dickens
[Charles Dickens] he had made head of IT, but after a while administrative
computing and all this kind of stuff was not what Chuck wanted to do, and
so Bill sat with him and realized that where Chuck wanted to go was where
the faculty were doing something exciting, where computing was going to be
the tool they were using without which they couldn’t do their research. So
Bill said, “You don’t have to be head of IT anymore,” made some other
choice there, and sent him over to SLAC to work with the faculty at SLAC.

79

And within nine months, they had found a new element, and Chuck felt
deeply invested in having helped with that.
So that makes a match. I worked. Suddenly I wasn’t just staffing
committees, but I was the ex-officio member of what was then called CAAA,
the Committee on Academic Achievement and Appraisal. I had a different
set of relationships with the faculty. I was an ex-officio member, as was Fred
Hargadon and Jim Lyons, of the [Academic Council, and I did that for
twenty years.
The computing thing, Stanford’s administrative computing was
supported by something called OASIS, the first word of which is Online. It
was a software designed by a group of guys who ate hamburgers at the Oasis
on El Camino in Menlo Park. So that’s why OASIS. They created an
acronym.
Tracy: [laughs] That’s funny.
Mahoney: [01:06:54] OASIS was very expensive in machine overhead. It was very, very
complicated to use, but it had a remarkable query capability. If you wanted to
array football players by academic major and graduation awards, you could
do that. Some people loved it, but maintaining it, it was a mess.
The year I arrived, somebody—and I came to realize this was the kind
of reason that Bill asked me to do the job. There was a guy named Epstein
who had something to do with SPIRES. SPIRES was our library
computational software, because Stanford always did its own internal
software. They showed up to tell me how they were going to help me out of
OASIS and into SPIRES, and they worked for, oh, maybe the better part of a

80

year. But in the first maybe three months, this guy and Mike Roberts and a
group of people would come to my office and tell me where they were.
Chuck Dickens didn’t. My eyes would glaze over. I had no idea what they
were talking about.
Finally one day—and it was sheer frustration—Chuck wasn’t there, but
Mike was. Mike was a talented administrator. And I finally said to this guy
[Epstein]—we were talking about I/Os and CPUs—”I have no idea what
you’re talking about. The only language you and I have in common is
English, so let me suggest that you stop talking your talk and start talking the
language we have in common. So what are you talking about?” Mike laughed,
and this guy looked aghast, and I said, “We don’t have to keep talking now,
but can you come back and tell me what I need to know in English?” So we
broke up the meeting, and they came back a week later.
In between, I gather Roberts and Dickens had gone to see Bill, filled
with, “She can take charge.” I mean, it was simple frustration on my part. I
wasn’t even polite. I just said, “I can’t do this anymore.” All I knew, I was
paying for it. Whatever it was they were talking about, I was paying for it.
So the next week they came, and they told me that I/Os and CPUs
were like feet and inches, they were units of measurement, and that’s what I
was paying for, and OASIS used too much of them and SPIRES was going
to be better. Well, I understood that.
These people were going to work with the staff to make the transition.
After about four or five months, I came to the realization that I tried out first

81

on Mike Roberts. I said, “I don’t think these guys can do this. I don’t think
the software,” I learned a word, “is robust enough to handle it.”
And he looked at me like, “You’re acquiring a vocabulary.”
And I said, “The way I think about it is that student records—and this
will also be true of development’s records—are, relatively speaking in the
swath of things, a relatively small number of records, but highly
complicated.” At the front end is admission, there’s demographic data,
there’s curricular data. In order that you have curricular data linked to the
student, you have to have a database of the curriculum, you know, all these
kinds of things.” So records are very complicated and highly interdependent,
and the people who use them have to be able to maintain their complexity.
So that’s (a).
Then, (b), SPIRES is a vast number of records. I don’t know how
many books we had in the library or might have twenty-five years from now,
but no one record has very many items in it, you know, author, publisher,
date of publication, maybe various data about topics and subtopics and
maybe a reach to other works by the same author, I mean, but it’s not
complicated. So I think these people are trying to impose this.
The next thing that happens—no one thinks this is very funny—is that
we were doing downsizing. Chuck Dickens comes to me with Roberts, not
with this technical guy, and he said, “We just can’t keep OASIS going. We
don’t want to have to administer it. We’ve got some stability in development
and we know how to handle that for a while.” He said, “I want to make a
transfer of an applications and operations group to you. You will be their

82

boss. You will have the money that supports them, and the quid pro quo is
that you will not make any major improvements to the system, but you will
keep it going long enough so that they and your people know how to
maintain a system so that when we come up with a better solution, whether
it’s SPIRES or something else, you will be ready.”
I said, “Sure.” I didn’t even know what it meant, but I said, “Sure.” So
I went down to Miller and I said, “This is the deal, and I think I should say
yes.”
And he said, “Oh, yes, so do I.” [Tracy laughs.]
So we had seven years of maintaining an old system. Now, we made
improvements to it that both the technical people and the staff loved, but
told nobody about because my deal was no improvements, but we’d get
things to work better. And in the meantime, the controller doesn’t want to
throw out his old batch systems that are falling apart and are the reason we
got into the indirect cost recovery problem.
But I’m working away. I produce from the staff—I mean, I had this
man who is our leader of software and this woman who is the leader of
operations, which means she schedules things, and then a new assistant
registrar who knows what they do, because I sure don’t, and we’ve gotten her
from development, so she knows what’s going on. And one day I agree that
faculty should input grade data on those things.
Tracy: Like those Scantron tests?

83

Mahoney: [01:16:13] Right. The classics department thinks I have given them a gift
beyond their wildest dreams, and I am visited by four chairs from
engineering, who say, “This is old technology. Why are you using it?”
And I say, “I’m using it because I can buy a scanner and put it in the
room across the hall because right now what happens is we take all of the
grades labeled A, B, whatever they are, and we send these raw documents to
San Jose to be input by an input house. If the truck carrying them ever was in
an accident and burned up, we would have nothing.” They went away, just
beside themselves that we were so backwards, but at least they had a reason.
So we did that for a couple more years, and by this time the staff knew
what it was doing. I was about to leave, but it was they knew how to maintain
a system, they knew how to do checks by sampling, and we had begun to use,
five, six years earlier, the data base in ways that Herant Katchadourian and I
made common cause with. I was able to provide the Committee on Graduate
Studies and Undergraduate Studies data for their use, but it was because I
had taken on this thing that was an orphan that nobody else wanted, but
where people who looked at it really knew they needed to keep for a while.
So that brought the Registrar’s Office into the twentieth century, if not
beyond, and it allowed us to say that we could use these data for university
decision-making of the sort that Herant thought was so important, and so
that’s what we did.
Tracy: Can you talk just a little bit more about—because it’s certainly significant in
terms of the Registrar’s Office, but very significant in terms of Herant’s

84

career—the sort of studies that you were doing, the information that you
were using?
Mahoney: [01:19:10] In the old days, the Registrar’s Office produced for Fred Terman,
using batch systems and then I don’t know what they used in that sort of
transition period, but this great big computer output report that identified
every course in the curriculum and identified aliases for the name of that
course if they were cross-listed so that Terman could see how large the
enrollments were. And we kept doing that, and people then gave this report
to their own people to try and make sense out of their own subsections of it,
H&S or whatever.
I remember the first year I was registrar, the phone rang and this voice
appeared and it was Fred Terman, who said, “Thank you for producing the
report on time.” I didn’t know whether it was early or late. “And I have some
suggestions if you can ever make that computer to work.”
I said, “Oh, OK.” [Tracy laughs.] And I said, “Why don’t you write me
a quick note that tells me the topics you want improved.”
And he did, and one of them was, “I’d really like to know the majors of
students who are taking these courses.”
So when Herant began to look at these data—and I have a couple of
those books somewhere in the back—Herant got exactly interested in the
same thing. So we designed a format. He had worked with a woman named
Sally Cole, who had been in the Dean of Students Office, and then with John
Boli, to define what it was they needed. By this time I had an institutional
research person, a fellow from Kerala, India, who could do things.

85

So Herant and I designed something, and basically what it did was say
this is the gross data for all majors [across the University], this is the gross
data by school, for example, H&S, and so English majors or French majors
or whatever, and it always compared a department’s data with the school and
with the group as a whole. Each report was about a different program, and
there were pages and pages of them, but you could find things. You could,
for example, discover that a number of enrollments in art history and in
some courses in art were taken by mechanical engineers in higher
proportions than would otherwise be random. And then when you looked at
art majors, not art history majors but art majors, more of them were taking
mechanical engineering design courses than was just random.
So Herant could go to chairs and say, “Do you know that you have
these cross-cutting constituencies, and have you ever talked to one another?”
you know, which people thought was an interesting idea. Again and again we
found overlaps. Biology majors, even Hum Bio majors, taking courses in the
School of Medicine. Not so odd, but almost nobody knew that
undergraduates took courses in the School of Medicine.
Herant was not somebody who once you had a paradigm kept
changing it, which is make-work for the poor souls who have to do it, but
also it doesn’t get you comparable data if you want to compare it over time.
So whatever the warts are, we might have tweaked it a little bit, but whatever
the warts were, they were what they were, but we could make and he could
make judgments that the Committee on Undergraduate Studies could pay
attention to, that other groups could pay attention to.

86

We could pull in data, not [just] from these reports, but from other
data. We didn’t really know which of our students went to graduate school.
In fact, we didn’t know which of our students took the GREs or the LSATs
or the whatever. Well, if you knew that, you could know what majors were
producing what kinds of professional study, those kinds of things. So people
began to say, “Oh, we can ask about that.” So we began to get—and our
[Registrar’s Office] institutional research person--based on people having
looked and asked questions about the stable reports, he would get questions
from departments. If departments were having a five-year review or a school
was having a specialized accreditation, they could use this. So it meant a lot
to Herant, but it also meant a lot to individual schools and departments, and
it meant that those schools and departments looked to the Registrar’s Office
to give them new insights.
The odd thing was that that database, which one of the sub-databases
of the student file was always the curriculum, you know, courses and degrees
and the time schedule, and you couldn’t have done this report without that
database. It came to have where did the course meet kind of data, at a time
when classrooms—this is the mid-eighties; Don Kennedy [Donald Kennedy]
is president—when classrooms were a forgotten item on the landscape of
maintenance. We were all concerned about money and classroom
maintenance.
One day Bill Clebsch in religious studies saw Don Kennedy walking
across Quad and called him back to Building 50 or 60, somewhere on one
side of the church or another, where there was a small classroom, probably a

87

lecture room of forty or fifty people, and he said to Don, “Look at this
room. Students bring clipboards to this room, because the wire in the
upholstered seats is coming through the upholstery, and people sit on
clipboards so as not to be impaled.”
Kennedy, I think, probably went to Rosse—
Tracy: Jim Rosse?
Mahoney: [01:28:31] Right. Who came to me and said, “What do you know about
classrooms?”
And I said, “I know that people complain about them and that there
are some rooms that you’d better put a really junior person in because
nobody else will put up with it, but I don’t otherwise know anything about
classrooms.”
So we put a lot of pressure on business and finance facilities people. I’d
go to these meetings, and business and finance visited me and they said,
“You hold the database on classrooms.”
And I said, “Yes.”
And they said, “Well, you know, we don’t know much about
classrooms other than when people call us up to complain. We don’t really
use your database.” They didn’t say, “We don’t want to use your database,”
which was more the truth. “How about if we give you the maintenance
budget for classrooms, and then you can maintain classrooms.”
Tracy: Did a maintenance budget for classrooms exist? [laughs]
Mahoney: [01:29:48] Well, that was news to me, and, again, it was just like taking on the
computer people. I said, “Yes.”

88

I came back to the office, told people what I had done, and Gloria
Gearing, who knew a lot about a lot of things, was assistant registrar, and
knew about courses and degrees and that part of the database. She said, “We
can’t let you go to meetings because you come back with some whole other
task.” [Tracy laughs.]
And I said, “Well, it’s a task that will have personnel and money.”
So I call this guy who has made this offer, and I say, “Could you tell me
what the maintenance budget is for classroom?”
And he says, cheerfully, “Fifty thousand dollars.” Now, that wouldn’t
paint two walls in Cubberley Auditorium.
So I go down to Rosse and Kennedy and I say, “I’m taking over
classrooms.”
And Don says, “This is good.”
I say, “I’m also taking on a maintenance budget. We’re in the middle of
downsizing again, but I’ve got to tell you, I’m coming to you for money, and
we’re going to do the absolutely worst ones first, and then we’re going to
make a plan for—.”
Tracy: Ongoing.
Mahoney: [01:31:19] “And in that process, we’re going to see if we can’t build a base
budget for classroom maintenance.”
Don asked the same question I had asked, “How much is the budget?”
And I said, “Fifty thousand dollars.” And those two men just laughed
and laughed. I mean, I didn’t think it was funny. [Tracy laughs.] But looked at
from the point of view of the square footage, it was laughable.

89

So they gave me $250,000 worth of one-time money for that first
summer, and we acted quickly and we did Cubberley Auditorium and we did
that building that Clebsch had a concern about, because, after all, he got
credit because he had really forced the issue, and then we did what we could
do, and we made a lot of people happy. But we did it because everybody
initially realized we could track classrooms in ways that business and finance
couldn’t and didn’t want to. I mean, it was a real orphan. So I would take
things on this way, and then in the meantime I would do provost staff stuff
as relief from doing all these things.
Tracy: Not to get you off track, but just because I was curious, at what point in this
evolution—this, I’m thinking would be earlier, but when did you become the
Title IX officer and what period of time did that sort of cover?
Mahoney: [01:33:04] Well, Title IX came around in ‘72, and the regs were out in ‘75.
Somewhere in that window Dick and Bill asked me if I would do an
assessment of our Title IX liabilities, and I said, “Sure.” Didn’t seem like
much of a deal.
And they said, “You should work with Jim Siena, who was then general
counsel to the university, and Iris Brest, who was a managing attorney and
knew all about civil rights things because she and Paul [Brest] had been in
Mississippi and had known what things the Office of Civil Rights looked for
when you do those kinds of assessments. She told me to count bathrooms.
And I said, “Not really?”
And she said, “Oh, yes, really.”

90

So I did a kind of preliminary assessment. It was clear that we had
residual problem of the Stanford 500 that had been honored in the breach
since the thirties, but as our graduate student body increased in size, that
whole thing that was about, you know, we can do this in spirit, because there
were so few graduate women that we can let the undergraduate student body
grow in size wasn’t going to cut it. So that was an issue.
Mahoney: [01:35:06] There was the issue that really at the behest of women students
who were member of sororities towards the close of the Second World War,
the university had banned sororities at the request of the women themselves,
but we had continued with fraternities, and that was an issue. So those were
the two big issues. There probably were pay and equity issues at the staff
level, so there was a Personnel Policy Committee established when Rob
Parker was director of personnel.
Then it turns out that bathrooms were an interesting subject,
specifically at Cubberley, where we had some women faculty. The faculty
restroom was a men’s restroom that had been breached by Elizabeth Cohen,
but there really weren’t any arrangements made. So, by and large, women
faculty at Cubberley, who used Cubberley, used the women’s public restroom
on the first floor, despite the fact that there was a faculty lounge upstairs, I
think on the third floor, that had a men’s restroom. So that kind of thing had
to get changed.
My name as Title IX officer went into courses and degrees, in the
information section of policies and who you can complain to and all that
kind of thing. One afternoon, a man I would judge was in his forties, walked

91

into my office and said he was a student in the business school and asked me
if I had ever been in an institution governed by a federal consent decree, and
I said, “No.”
And he said, “You’re running the risk of that happening,” which
perked me up. And he said that this was a time at which—and it was early, it
was late seventies, early eighties, when there were a couple of women
assistant professors in the business school. It was not only faculty who had
reservations about women professors in the business school, it was also
business school students who thought, some of them, that were it known
that some of their courses had been taught by women, their degrees would
be demeaned. A greater piece of nonsense I couldn’t imagine.
Arjay Miller was the dean, and Rob Jaedicke [Robert K. Jaedicke] was
the associate dean, and they certainly didn’t hold these views. They gave great
support to the women, including Myra Strober, who was one of those
women.
And this man said to me, “You know, it’s subtle and ugly at the same
time.” He said, “The deans take student evaluation of teaching effectiveness
very, very seriously, so people who get bad reviews don’t get reappointed.”
And he said, “There are messages in the men’s bathroom in Arbuckle,”
which was in the basement of the business school just off a student area,
“that basically say you should pay attention to the reviews you give those
women professors.” And he said, “Most people pay no attention and go in
and out because they’re just doing their business, but it’s a messaging system
that you might be troubled by.”

92

And I said, “Thank you. I will see that it’s looked into.” I had the wit
not to say, “I will look into it.” I remember that.
I picked up the phone and I called Bob Jaedicke, the associate dean,
and I told him the story, and he said, “There’s a faculty bathroom, so nobody
goes down there.”
And I said, “Well, can I ask you to pay it a visit?”
And he did, and he phoned me back and he said, “The gentleman who
visited you was right to be concerned. I’m sorry he didn’t come to me or the
dean, but I’m grateful for your message, and this will be taken care of.”
So they spent some time working on it, and I have every reason to
think—I never saw that man again. But it was an interesting—I mean, Iris
was right to say, “Pay attention to bathrooms,” which had never occurred to
me.
The university wasn’t in any trouble over this, but over time those
notions got paid attention to. When we renovated the stadium, there are now
more women’s restrooms in the stadium than there used to be, and the
reason is not simply that there were too few; it’s the timing principle. You
need more for the same numbers, because women spend more time in stalls
than men. So that was the story.
Tracy: I may be misunderstanding this, but did you deal with any—it seems that
sexual harassment policies came up during that time.
Mahoney: [01:41:45] Well, certainly a big one came up. By and large, the schools were
good about taking care of them, and I don’t remember staff harassment
issues, but by the time Amy Blue got over to business and finance, they

93

would have been paid attention to, but also I credit business and finance as
paying attention to those issues, both before Bill Massy was business vice
president, during, and after. So I don’t remember those coming up, but I do
remember the school issues and I remember that the key people in helping
schools deal with them were Leah Kaplan, the university’s ombudsperson,
who was the wife, then widow of Henry Kaplan in radiology, and Alberta E.
Siegel in the medical school, and also Eleanor Maccoby [Eleanor E
Maccoby], who I think is still alive, living at Vi.
So there was a network of people who paid attention in the schools,
but sometimes you heard—I would hear from Alberta about stories that I
took cognizance of but didn’t get involved in, a case of an infuriated human
biology student who was going to have some kind of undergraduate research
assistantship with somebody in the medical school, and he propositioned her
in some fashion, which she rejected. And she was furious, and she went into
that cafeteria in the Medical Center and, by happenstance, sat down next to a
graduate student—I don’t think a medical student, I think in one of the
disciplines of medicine, of the medical school, and spouted about having
been propositioned. And the women she was venting on said, “Oh, I know
him. He did that to me too.”
And this young woman said, “We will take care of this. We will go see
my freshman advisor.” And this graduate woman thought she was witless.
Well, her freshman advisor was Don Kennedy. [Tracy laughs.] So they
went over to Building 10, and the dean put together an investigation, and
Alberta was involved in that investigation, which proved to be quite true, and

94

it needed in its outcome to go to the Advisory Board because any punitive
reduction in pay or status—and I think this was a reduction in pay,
temporary reduction in pay—has to go to the Advisory Board for vetting.
Alberta said that people in the department, when she, at the dean’s
behest, was doing this investigation, she said people said to her, “This can’t
be true. He has such a nice wife and some nice kids.”
And Alberta said to me, “That is not what this is about. We don’t need
to make this part of the family, but we need to take care of it.”
So my sense was that the issue was there, but the schools did a better
job of it with the help of Kaplan and Siegel especially, and maybe others. The
real issue was getting women into the faculty, and what Miller had done
earlier helped that, but somebody like Elisabeth Pate-Cornell was a lone
ranger for a very long time in engineering. And, of course, departments like
political science were notorious. That department when—and it must have
been ‘79, so it was post-Title IX, didn’t have a single woman or a single
person of color in it. And both Lyman and Miller put a lot of pressure on
Alex George [Alexander L. George], who was the chair of poli-sci, which was
one of the two or three largest undergraduate major programs in the
university: biology, human biology, poli-sci, and history. Engineering
clustered together was bigger, but no one engineering [discipline].
Alex George was, that year, president of the American Political Science
Association, and Lyman and Miller both said to him, “Your association is a
place that young PhD got to get jobs. There’s a network operating there. We
will not take it kindly if you come back with no prospects.”

95

And at that time there was affirmative action money. Miller had put an
affirmative action fund together. I didn’t have the affirmative action fund,
but for some reason, George came to see me to report what he was about to
report to Miller, and it was that he had found a woman who was an expert in
Soviet military history, and if you put her behind a screen and had her speak
Russian, you would think she was a native speaker. And he said to me, “Do
you think I can get affirmative action money out of Miller for that?”
And I said, “Absolutely, provided you can give him one piece of
information. That piece of information is when that woman is ready for
tenure—this is mortgage money—whose retirement place will she be
taking?”
And he looked at me for a long time and he said, “If you add seven to
next year, it will be my place.”
I said, “Fine. Go and tell your story. That will be welcomed.”
And he got to the door, and he turned around and he said to me, “Oh,
I didn’t tell you, she’s African American.” It was Condi.
[01:49:55] The same year by coincidence, the department was bringing
Bob Keohane to the department, but he wouldn’t come unless his wife could
come too. They were recently married. I don’t know whether each of them
had been divorced and married one another or only one of them, but in any
event, they had blended family. He was not about to come unless she had a
position, and she was not about to come to a lecturer’s position. But there
was no mortgageable place in that department. She took the position, and
Bob with her—I had nothing to do with this—that by the time she was ready

96

for tenure, she would have been so good at what she did, which is really
philosophy of politics, that the university would make a billet for her, and
that happened.
Both women were tenured, and having been tenured, Condi went off
to work in Bush 1 administration and came back, and so I could use her on
the Admission Committee. That isn’t why she came back, but that’s what I
used. [Tracy laughs.] And Nan [Keohane] was stellar. It must have been
Bob’s proposition when she came, that they would make a position for her.
It was true. She was chair of the Senate and went off to Wellesley College
and then to Duke.
Tracy: Yes, that was what I was going to ask you. I couldn’t remember where she
went.
Mahoney: [01:51:51] Right. And I remember when I was in Atlanta, I met, through one
of my trustees at some club, a Duke trustee who said to me, “You know Nan
Keohane?”
And I said, “Sure.”
And he said, “Do you know she understands football?”
I said, “Oh, yes, I do.” [laughter] So, I mean, it was very funny, because
by this time she had come to the South, to Duke, which cared little about
football, but king at Duke is basketball.
So faculties were taking Lyman and Miller and Kennedy and then
Hastorf, who became provost after Kennedy, seriously. H&S really worked
on having women. Jim Gibbons, I think, needs a lot of credit, because he was
aware that Title IX issues had early on to do with how many women

97

undergraduates were there so there could be women graduate students. One
of the things Herant’s data and mine produced for Jim was the insight—John
Boli worked on this—that if a man got a B-minus in something, he checked
it off, a prerequisite taken care of, go forward. If a woman got a B-plus, she
wasn’t sure she could be an engineer. And that finding is replicated all over
the country.
Jim did a very interesting thing. He took a group of freshmen women
who were struggling. They were perfectly adequate, but they felt they were
struggling. And he wanted them to be successful strugglers, and he got them
summer paid internship jobs at places like Bechtel or PG&E, and they went
out in the field with hard hats, with people who were engineers, and they met
all sorts of people. They met people who climbed telephone poles and who
were Hispanic and who said, “Oh, it would be wonderful if my daughter
could work for Bechtel like you. You’re an engineer. You have a clipboard
and a hard hat.” That’s how they knew who the professional engineers were
out in the field.
Tracy: That’s funny.
Mahoney: [01:54:51] And that group of women—there weren’t many of them; maybe
there were ten of them—they came back that fall. And when you talk to
women students in science and engineering, usually pre-med and science and
then engineers, they would have said in the past, “I am thinking about
studying engineering,” or chemistry or biology. That group of women said,
“I’m an engineer.” The grade thing was put into context because everybody
out in the field thought they were useful, and the people who were not

98

professional engineers were quite certain they were engineers. And they
talked about those experiences as being very useful. Gibbons took that to
heart and he tried to do other things as well. He tried to get women into the
faculty. But those were important things, more important from the point of
view of things that I did than harassment.
Now, my very last days at Stanford involved me in a sexual harassment
policy issue, or sexual harassment charge, which Fran Conley mentions in her
book. It was alleged by somebody in radiology which was known as a place
where there were issues.
Tracy: An aggressive atmosphere?
Mahoney: [sentences deleted] There was some complaint made to the dean of medicine,
say, in the middle of the week. That same complaint in all its detail appeared
in the San Jose Mercury in the Sunday edition on Saturday, arguing,
complaining about the harassment of women in radiology. This man [the
department chair who was the focus of the allegation] was asked about it the
next Friday night when he went to temple, and his kid was asked about it at
school. It was terrible.
So the dean put together a committee. The committee did an
investigation. I was part of the committee. Alberta was part of the
committee. There was a group of us. We had a court reporter in the room at
all times. We interviewed every tech in the hospital that worked with the
department. We worked with everybody in the department. We had
something like sixty-three interviews.

99

I came away from that process absolutely convinced that everybody in
the department was harassed and that it was an equal opportunity
harassment. It wasn’t sexual. Women felt harassed especially when you
combined their professional work with their family work, but men felt
harassed. PhD men in the department felt harassed. It was a place of
harassment. But we found no reason to think that this poor new chair of the
department was the harasser. We did find reason to believe that there was
somebody who didn’t like his coming who might have been the source of
this, but we didn’t get into that, as our charge was merely to find what the
story was.
So that was my most exciting harassment story. I mean, sixty-three
people and a court reporter whose salary just from us must have been in the
six figures. They talked with medical terminology that I certainly didn’t
understand. She would stop them and ask them if they meant this or that.
She had a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in some medical sciences field.
But it was taken very seriously. So, no, I think sexual harassment claims have
been seriously taken at Stanford.
Tracy: Anything else about—how long did you serve as the Title IX officer?
Mahoney: [02:00:48] Oh, endlessly, just, like, you know, you just need a name. So
anytime somebody would come—and I guess when I left the university, they
got somebody else.
But when we took some of these matters to the Board of Trustees,
when we took the sorority thing to the Board of Trustees, it got tabled by the
board, because the board got enormous amount of pushback from Mrs.

100

Harold Bacon, who had been an assistant dean in 1944 when this happened,
when women said no, when people like Sandra Day O’Conner, who was then
a trustee, said to us—she wasn’t yet a Supreme Court Justice; she was a
politician in the Arizona legislature—she said, “Title IX can’t possibly mean
this.”
Turned out one of the trustees who was with the Sierra Club had been
one of the very few undergraduate men on campus. I think he’d been 4F, so
he couldn’t get drafted, and he felt a duty to the women who had worked so
hard, to get rid of sororities for good reasons—that’s a long story—that he
didn’t feel he could vote for it. It was wild.
So we crept back, Don and Jim Lyons and I, and Jim Lyons had lunch
with Roz Bacon, who said, “I have a duty to the women who fought so hard
against this terrible thing.” Jim did a good job of it, so we went back.
The way it got stopped the first time was not that they just wouldn’t
vote, Robert Minge Brown went out to an outer room and brought back a
big legal book, and he opened it and he said, “Until we check this, we can
take no decision.” And I realized he was reading from the book upside down.
I mean, it was theater. And I said to someone, I don’t know who, “He was
reading from the book upside down.”
And whoever it was said to me, “Sally, he’s been a trial lawyer. He
understands drama.” He needed to get this out of the room, and he did.
So then we came back and it wasn’t quite the consent calendar, but it
got settled, and part of the way it got settled was the women on the board
and the man who remembered 1944 abstained, so no women voted for the

101

return of sororities to Stanford. And they were right to say we weren’t
bringing them a proposal that said we have to have sororities. We said we
had to eliminate the prohibition. And they said if we eliminate the
prohibition, somebody will want them, and that happened.

PROJECT:

STANFORD STAFF ORAL HISTORY PROJECT

INTERVIEWER:

ALLISON TRACY

INTERVIEWEE:

SALLY T. MAHONEY

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MARCH 26, 2014

Tracy: Hi. This is Allison Tracy. It’s March 26, 2014. I’m here with Sally Mahoney
to conclude our oral history interviews for the Stanford Historical Society.
Sally, when we had left off, we were talking about your time as
registrar. Next for you was your time as acting vice president for student
resources. So let’s spend a little bit of time talking about the budget context
in which you came into that position.
Mahoney: [00:00:35] There were the usual budget issues which had to do with the rate
of growth of the budget (a concern in and of itself), also the faculty concerns
with the indirect-cost recovery rate, and puzzlement about why the rates of
growth were what they were in areas of student support. So that was one
piece. We also were dealing with the federal government around the indirectcost recovery controversy and so that was always present.
Jim Rosse [James N. Rosse] said to me one day that he was thinking of
a reorganization. Since I had always balanced being registrar on one hand
with being a provost staff person on the other, I knew that these
conversations had been going on. He said he wanted to think about an
organization he called “student resources” which would have a vice

103

president; he wanted me to take it on and see if it could be made to work. So
that got me to that role.
I was one of several university vice presidents who sat as part of the
president’s cabinet. The first thing I did was try and get a handle on what the
pieces were. The big pieces were the Dean of Students Office, the Office of
the Dean of Admission, the Office of Financial Aid, and the Advising
Center—no, excuse me—and the Office of Registrar. Those were the big
pieces there. Actually, the Advising Center moved into that orbit as we
restructured things.
It was a time at which a couple of people said it was time for them to
move on: Jim Lyons [James W. Lyons], who had been the dean of students,
who had, by far, the largest organization of the entities that were within
student resources, and Jean Fetter, the dean of admission. During that time, I
had the responsibility to see that searches occurred for both the dean of
admission and the dean of students.
Those were faculty-led searches. Tom Wasow was the professor who
chaired the admission search committee. Condi Rice [Condoleezza Rice],
who had just returned from her stint at the National Security Office, was also
a member of that committee. The chair of the dean of students search was
Lincoln Moses. So we had good people who agreed to proceed with that.
As those searches were going on, I with others in the budget
committee were wrestling with the pieces of the budget that came to us. It
became necessary to slow the growth of student affairs, not so much
admission, because the growth of the admission function was by virtue of the

104

constant increase in the size of the applicant pool. They were doing more not
so much with less but without more. Since the proportion of students who
needed financial aid was not so much growing, because the admitted
population wasn’t increasing so much but nonetheless had an impact in
financial aid.
In the Registrar’s Office we had some opportunities to use technology
to substitute for other kinds of expenses; although the startup costs of
technology are expensive, the results downstream are good.
Tracy: Who did you end up bringing in for the dean of admission and the dean of
students?
Mahoney: [00:06:16] One of the applicants, and from the point of view of the search
committee, the strongest applicant for the dean of admission position was
Jim Montoya [James Montoya]. Jim had been a Stanford undergraduate who
was very influential in how the university thought about the recruitment of
Hispanic students, specifically Mexican-American students. As an
undergraduate, he had found his way to a position on the Academic
Council’s Committee on Admission and Financial Aid; for the work he did
there and the style of it and the impact it had, he was awarded a Dinkelspiel
Prize.
[00:07:15] When he left Stanford, Fred Hargadon had been instrumental in
recommending Jim Montoya to Occidental College as an assistant in their
admission office. Subsequently he became dean of admission there, working
under President Slaughter [John Brooks Slaughter] who is a very
distinguished liberal arts college president.

105

Then Jim [Montoya] went to Vassar, first as dean of admission and
then as dean of students, which is where he was when the search commenced
to find a successor to Jean Fetter. He was the choice of the search committee
and I was delighted with that. There were good candidates so it was a good
search.
I called him. He said he knew he had the job because no one would call
with bad news on the Fourth of July. He was just initiating a barbecue when
I called. So that went well.
The second search [for Dean of Students] involved both inside and
outside candidates. Michael Jackson was appointed. He was certainly known
in the environment. I think that people in Building 10 had worked with him.
It was a constructive search.
We moved to an issue that had come up from time to time but never
been resolved over a lot of years in financial aid: the financial responsibility
of the noncustodial parent in divorced and separated situations. The practice
of the Ivy League and a variety of other private schools was to account for
the capacity of the noncustodial parent as well as the custodial parent. That
was not our practice. Our practice mirrored the general rules of the federal
FAFSA [Free Application for Federal Student Aid] form where the
responsibility was of the custodial parent. Many people at Stanford—Don
Kennedy [Donald Kennedy] among them...when he married Robin she had
two children and he became much more sympathetic to the question of what
would you do in a situation that was hostile between the two parents. He
didn’t want to see college-bound students caught between their parents.

106

As it happened, I had an advisee who was a counterexample to that. I
didn’t know how many were like him but I felt it worth discussing. We didn’t
know, because we had no data, how much looking to the assets of the
noncustodial parent would bring us if we took their capacity into account.
We did have the sense that the custodial parent was typically the mother and
that typically mothers made less than fathers. That’s all we knew. We didn’t
know what the reality of that was, especially if the noncustodial parent had
moved on to a second family.
I had an advisee whose mother and father both were Stanford
classmates; they delivered him to school together, although they spent no
time together when they arrived at the dorm. She was working as an
administrative assistant in a small college. He was living alone in a
condominium facing the ocean in Santa Monica. Both were very nice people.
I met them both. They both came to Parents’ Weekend, again separately, but
they were both there. I managed to say hello to both.
The father stayed over. The next thing I knew, the young man had a
little Miata so he didn’t have to ride his bike all the time, and he had $1,000+
skis to go skiing if he wanted to, and a rack on his Miata. So I used him as a
sort of anecdotal example which amused people.
I called this man, whose name I don’t remember, and said, “You do
very nice things for your son. Why don’t you support him in terms of the
cost of education?”
And he said quite matter-of-factly, “Nobody ever has asked me to.”
I said, “Oh.”

107

So we began to ask ourselves “Are there others of him?” And if there
are—and we don’t want these young people caught between two parents—
can we do this as a general policy to which the exemptions would be case-bycase? And that’s what we tried. What they’re doing now I don’t know but
that was one of the policy issues that I dealt with while I was doing that job.
One of the things we did not do (it did not come up, though about
four years later it did) and did not occur to us was to merge admission and
financial aid. We wanted to maintain that separation that said admission
makes its decisions cleanly and financial aid responds with a package for
whomever it is admission admits. And it’s interesting to me that I have no
recollection that that came up from anyone during that period of time.
One kind of issue did and was responded to. The other did not but did
four years later and I don’t know the details of that. Both Bob Huff [Robert
P. Huff] and Jim Montoya would be people who would know the answers to
that.
So those were the things I did in student resources. That organization
later became vice provost for student something. So it was a vice president
who reported to the provost as well as to...it was a little muddy. But it
became a vice provost I think when Jim Montoya...or perhaps even during
Mary Edmonds’s time.
At the end of that time, I went over to the business school for a year
and was part of the Sloan Program. It was a very interesting period and I am
grateful to Jim Rosse and Don Kennedy for making that possible. It is a
program that at the time was to commit you forever to your employer so you

108

could become the CEO of that company. The icon of the Stanford Sloan
[Program] was Sir John Browne of British Petroleum [BP] who moved from
a kind of lower senior management job at BP to the CEO of the corporation.
So he was the model.
I was never going to be the CEO of Stanford but I did have this
arrangement for leaving the university: my plan was to stay in my home and
do remediation work with schools that were on the cusp of trouble with their
accreditors. I had done a lot of accreditations as Stanford’s liaison. I had
done one or two site visits a year to increasingly precarious institutions.
My plan was to take formal retirement from Stanford and do this but I
got a phone call one day from an executive-search person with whom I had
been on a panel in Washington, DC, about women in higher education. She
said to me, “Sally, I want to talk to you about coming to Atlanta, Georgia.” I
must have paused a very long time because her next words were, “It’s in the
United States.” [Tracy laughs.]
I said, “For what reason?”
She said, “Agnes Scott College needs an interim. It has gone through a
bad time. Its faculty a year ago voted no confidence in its president. In
Atlanta, when the faculty at Agnes Scott College are unhappy, the alumnae
who largely live in Georgia are unhappy, and this is not good for the college.
We need somebody who has a big view and can be a peacemaker and who,
incidentally, can do strategic planning.”
I said, “I don’t have a PhD and this is a religious institution and I am
not a Presbyterian.”

109

She said, “No matter. Can I give the search committee your name?”
I said, “Yes.”
The next thing I knew, Joe Gladden [Joseph R. Gladden Jr.], who was
chairman of the board, called me. He was also the general counsel of the
Coca-Cola Corporation, and his wife was an alum. We talked. He said, “Do
you have any idea what an interim does?”
I thought, “Oh, I hope you know.” [Tracy laughs.] I said to him,
“Maybe begin with the Hippocratic Oath—do no harm—and then do some
good if the trustees can say what that good is.”
He asked me to visit. I did. They offered me the job. It was an
absolutely splendid year. I brought skill sets and insights from Stanford that
were useful to them. My experiences at Stanford had not been in a single
department—they’d been wide-ranging—so I had a perspective.
It was the year before the Olympics in Atlanta. It was very exciting.
There were throwaway lines in my resume because somebody told me I
needed to say something about my community involvement. I am a founding
member of the Palo Alto University Rotary and was its president in 1989-90.
I was the first woman president of a Rotary in this district and probably the
second one in America (which probably means the world). People talked
about that... trustees. Would I be willing to go to the Atlanta Rotary? And I
said, “Sure.” What that said was I had a community sense.
What I had not understood was that the big downtown Rotary in
Atlanta was one of two or three entities which had been absolutely influential
in securing the Olympics. It was a place where black leadership in Atlanta

110

and white leadership could come together. Atlanta was a place, at least in the
1990s, where largely political Atlanta was African American but business
Atlanta was still largely white. Rotary was one of the places where they came
together. Agnes Scott College was another.
So I became involved in all sorts of things having to do with the
Olympics. Scott is the Wellesley of the South. It’s academically very rigorous
and it is very conscious of the civic responsibility of their students and alums.
The college had said it would participate in President Carter’s Atlanta Project,
overseeing the part of the project that was to be in Decatur. They assumed
that, because there was a change in president, that would stop.
I talked to the senior staff about it. It seemed to me that all the pieces
were in place so there was no reason for me to say “no” to it. I wrote a letter
to Mr. Carter saying we were prepared to continue as planned. That
willingness to continue affected Atlanta. It was interesting what mattered. It
said to Atlanta that Agnes Scott is not falling apart. They are continuing to
do the things they had committed to. It said their president was willing to be
involved. It said in the faculty there’s continuity here, even though there’s
been a very disruptive change.
They wanted a strategic plan. The guidelines of the strategic plan were
as follows, which was interesting to me, given my various BAP [Budget
Adjustment Program] and BEP [Budget Equilibrium Program] and other
activities. This college was six hundred students. It had over $350 million in
endowment. About two-thirds of that was Coca-Cola stock that could not be
sold. So they wanted a strategic plan that would sharpen the focus of the

111

college by reducing courses, majors, and departments. That was the mandate.
There was a trustee on the Strategic Planning Committee, as there had been
on the last Policy Review Committee at Stanford, John Lilly. I thought,
“How are we going to get through this?” We solved the problem by late
January.
At the same time, the board was saying to me...the board had plenty of
money for things that mattered but they were very frugal. If you had budget
x, you didn’t spend x plus y. They said to me that second meeting (I guess in
Executive Committee) that they were concerned that the changes that Agnes
Scott would be making couldn’t be made effectively with some of the faculty
we had. They had been around too long and could not make change.
I said, “Why don’t you try an early retirement program.” So I talked to
them about Stanford’s early retirement program and how it had worked and
how it had created payouts per individual. I thought I could work with the
academic dean and the vice president for business and see if we couldn’t
come up with a proposal. I brought them a proposal probably just before
Christmas. Down at the end of the table someone said, “This is good
provided that, when you bring us a list of names, the following names are on
it.” He gave me two names. Everybody in the room froze.
I said, “You have to understand this is voluntary. We cannot prevent
people from opting in that we would hate to see go nor can we make this
involuntary, in which case you would have the problem that you would have
firing anybody tenured. But let me see what I can do.” I knew that the two
names that he had given me had come up as problematic in other settings.

112

The first of the two came along. He was looking for a way out. This
retirement package provided what he needed. The other person was deeply
conflicted and nothing was happening. One night I called the dean who had
hired him (who subsequently became the president at another institution). I
told him the story. I said, “You have to help me.”
He said he would. He called me one morning and said, “This
gentleman will be in your office about 8:30. He has written and I have
watched him sign a letter requesting the program. My suggestion is that you
have coffee and some sweet rolls ready for him and we’ll see how it goes.”
He came in. It was touch and go but it got accomplished. So I could go
in to the board saying, “We have to spend x.”—$2.5 million, I think, was the
payout for this program which they gladly wrote a check for. I looked down
at the table and said, “The list includes the names you mentioned in
December.”
Joe Gladden looked at me and said, “It does?”
I said, “Yes.” So we got it done and, in the process, alumnae were
happier—everything was happier.
They did a national search, and the faculty, having had a president
they came to distrust, were preparing questions that would be appropriate to
an inquisition.
[00:30:31] I finally went to the faculty who were going to do some of this
interviewing and said, “‘Interview’ means ‘between.’ It doesn’t mean
‘inquisition.’ You have to remember that this faculty has voted no confidence
in the president. This makes candidates leery. So you have to be on your

113

good, southern-hospitality behavior and moderate your questions. And you
know how to do this,” as I knew they did.
They all laughed, and they did it, and we got a wonderful president. She
was an alumna of the college from the middle 1960s. She had been a
Stanford graduate student working with Lyman Van Slyke, who I had known
as my neighbor. Her husband had a degree in American history from
Stanford, a PhD.
[After] I left, I stayed connected to Agnes Scott. I was there late last
spring for an alumnae weekend. The trustees and the faculty and a variety of
others had a series of events for me. It was a very, very good experience. If
you were going to transition out of Stanford, this was a very good place to
have done it. It was intellectually rigorous. It understood money. It
understood relationships. It was religious in a way that I came to appreciate
when I went off to two Catholic schools. Far better was their board at
dealing with issues of religion than were the two Catholic schools I went to.
I learned a great deal in Atlanta. I learned how to work with a board
that was smaller. I think I was accepted in part because I had come from
Stanford. In fact, I have a little faculty resolution in my office that says, “She
came from afar from a distinguished place but she didn’t look down on us.”
[00:33:22] That kind of thing. But there was no reason to look down on
them. They were, and still are, very, very good. I shocked them by saying,
“We ought to increase the size of the student body,” at the same time we
were reducing courses, majors, and departments. I argued that the school was
so small that, at the major level, classes were so small that no student had a

114

place to hide. You had to be prepared every day in everything and I thought
that added to the stress of the place.
They had an honor code. I was familiar with an honor code. We had
many things [in common]. It taught me that skills are transferrable from
places that you would think are quite unlike. I don’t think the transition from
private to public or public to private would be as easy but private to private
value structures are similar even though orders of magnitude are not. So that
was that place.
As I was getting ready to leave Agnes Scott, I got a letter from a person
in Milwaukee who said he was on the board and chair of the Finance
Committee of a school called Mount Mary College in Milwaukee. I called him
and asked him why he thought he needed an interim because by this time I
had learned that the first thing you do is look to see if there is somebody
inside who can hold the place together. When Wally Sterling [J. E. Wallace
Sterling] left the presidency, Dr. Glaser [Robert J. Glaser] came in as the
interim for a year while we were looking for the appointment that turned out
to be Ken Pitzer [Kenneth S. Pitzer]. The first question was, “Why not an
insider?” and his response to that was, “Because there’s blood on the floor.”
[00:35:29] They had done a search. Their last president had been a Sister, a
member of the religious order that had founded the institution. She told
them when she was sixty-eight that she would retire at seventy and they
should start thinking about a search. She did the right thing.
They limited the search to sisters and, even fifteen years ago, that was a
small pool and an even smaller one now. They came up dry and then tried to

115

recover from that by doing a second search that was even worse than the
first. By this time, all of Milwaukee knew it was a mess. The faculty were
unhappy. The faculty did not believe they could be the same kind of school if
there was not a sister in the president’s office.
I had done a fair amount of work as a trustee or in other respects and I
had a done a lot of accrediting of denominational schools including Catholic
ones. So I went up and talked to them and I talked to the faculty. I realized
very quickly when I got there and I said to the board in October, “I hope we
like one another well enough because to do what you want me to do, which
is ready the institution for a lay president (I think that’s what you want), is
going to take two years. The reason it is going to take two years is that the
presidential search cycle is an autumn cycle where you winnow your
candidates sometime in early December and have candidates come in
January. If they are not successful in seeking a presidency, they can say to the
president who let them go off on these search excursions, ‘I’m prepared to
stay another year.’ If you start looking in April, those people have signed
contracts. Ethically you get a problematic pool or in terms of quality you get
a problematic pool.”
So they all agreed. I had, as a condition of coming, gotten them to
agree that, when they got around to doing a search, they would hire a search
firm. I was prepared to help them do that but that this [had been] amateur
night and, if repeated, would have a similar result. They were grateful for
that.

116

There were issues there in addition to religious leadership. They had an
investment policy that was antiquated despite the fact the board was very
financially savvy. So we changed investment policies. We also did a strategic
plan.
I said that the college should join a library consortium. Our librarians
some ten years before had organized and then, for reasons incomprehensible
to me, the college wouldn’t sign the contractual document that made them
part of the consortium. Various people came to me and said, “You missed an
opportunity ten years ago. Would you reconsider?”
We did. What it meant—and it was a simple thing because there are
several small colleges in the Milwaukee area—was that we created a common
library database. You could look in the database and say, “What I want is at x
of these colleges, it is on the shelf, it is not out, and I will put a claim on it.”
If you put a claim on it, it would be delivered to your campus library within
twenty-four hours. It was a very slick system. It meant that distinctive or
even unique collections that might be in one institution but not getting a lot
of use could be made available to others without a lot of hassle. It was an
important element.
In the second year, the board and its search committee, which included
faculty and students and alumni and the usual suspects, hired a search firm, a
very good one, and got three splendid candidates. Faculty were coming into
my office saying, “We feel so badly. Only one of them can be chosen and we
have to reject the others.” [Tracy laughs.]

117

And I said, “Don’t worry. Each of these women will have a presidency
within six weeks.”
Mahoney: We got a splendid president.
During my tenure there, I arrived to discover that the vice president for
finance was going to Florida with his wife and we hadn’t closed the books. I
arranged to have that done and hired a vice president for business. I
discovered that we were without a leader of our development function. No
one told me the position was empty until I said, “Who is coming to the
president’s cabinet meeting for development?”
My secretary said, “Oh, that position is vacant.”
“Oh.” [Tracy laughs]
[00:41:46] I did a search and hired a woman named Mary Finger who had just
finished doing the fundraising effort in support of Northwestern
[University’s] undergraduate library and so was ready to move on. She was
originally from Milwaukee so it was coming home for her.
We developed a pretty sophisticated small school fundraising program,
which startled people. I realized we were going to have to try and bring to
the board people who knew that this was important. Mary did a wonderful
job of that. She stayed on with my successor for ten years.
The year after Pat [Patricia O’Donoghue] got there, which was the year
after I left, they started a $15 million campaign but raised $32 million. Mary
was a terrific fundraiser.
[00:42:57] After Pat left the presidency, she [Mary] went down to DePaul
University, where she is presently.

118

[Mary Finger] has just been named president of Seton Hill University in
Pennsylvania to which she is going in August. So she was a very good hire.
Again, a different kind of place. We worked with the faculty on the fact
that they were the culture carriers of this religious tradition and what that
meant. I went to sisters who were in the retirement home of the
congregation. We did a number of things that helped that along. Although
none of the candidates, including the appointee, had ever worked with this
particular congregation of sisters, all of them understood the issue and knew
what you did to engage that tradition as part of the mission of the institution.
I said to the board, “This congregation’s leadership, which is not at the
college (it is close by with more general responsibilities), cannot function
here by benign neglect. It’s got to say, ‘We support you.’” And that was done.
My Stanford experience was interesting and did not need to be brought
to [bear in this regard] at Agnes Scott. Agnes Scott is right up there, because
this was an institution founded to memorialize a person who was the mother
of one of the founders. At Mount Mary, they didn’t have any sense of
founder. And I thought, “We have to connect people not to the last
president but to a long tradition.”
One day I was in the basement with some people. There were, as there
always are in basements, these nineteenth-century oil paintings with gilded
frames. Stanford Museum is filled with them. They were of nuns! I said,
“Who are these people?”
“This is Sister Theresa,” of something or other, “and Sister Imelda,” of
something or other.

119

I said, “Who were they?”
Somebody said to me, “One of them is the founder of the college.”
I said, “Why is her portrait in the warehouse, basically?”
We pulled them out, put them up in a lounge area, and put a sign next
to them that said, “These two sisters are part of our history. If you want to
know something about them, there will be coffee and cookies at four o’clock
on Thursday afternoon.” The word went out to the retirement center and
four or five sisters showed up as well as probably about forty people from
the college.
[00:46:54] I said, “I’m told that this one is Sister Theresa, the founder of this
place, and this other sister came with her. Who knows anything?” And these
old sisters started to talk. So they promised to bring us documents. They
promised to bring us pictures that had been taken from the college and
brought out to the mother house because they thought no one cared.
When someone said, “Why did you do that?” I said, “Once a year
Stanford honors the founders. There is a tradition of a service at Memorial
Church and then a procession from Memorial Church to the mausoleum,
where we are greeted by the head of the Stanford Historical Society, who
reads the Stanford founding grant to us. Then the gates to the mausoleum
are opened, and we go and we thank Big Leland and Little Leland and Jane
—and Jane’s brother is there as well.”
I said, “So I’m used to talking about a place having values that are
connected to its founders.”

120

People thought that was interesting. For me, it was just an everyday
way of thinking. It is an example of a Stanford experience translating for me
to make something useful for a college that had lost its sense of its history.
That was one of the things I did for them.
Of course (one always knows this) elderly sisters in retirement homes
have friends in the lay community. The word went out that, whoever she was
over there, somebody should show up at the next alumnae meeting because
she was doing some good things. When they showed up, I would talk about
this. I would also say, “We need to find ways—you as alums, me as the
president—to make our faculty empowered as the custodians of this
tradition.”
Goodness knows, the tradition—and this is true of the history of
women religious across this country—was that these were very young
women who showed up, usually from Europe, to do something utterly
daunting—founding institutions—which they did. People need to know
about that.
So that’s what I did for Mount Mary: their investment policy; their
sense of who they were; the sense of the faculty’s empowerment; and the
sense that they could ask for money and they would get it because they had a
good story to tell. That was them.
As I was getting ready to leave Mount Mary (and again [assuming] I
was coming back here to my house on campus and [doing] this accreditedinstitution-in-trouble thing), I got a call from the same executive search
person who had brought me to Agnes Scott.

121

This time she was doing a search in Texas at Our Lady of the Lake
University. I went there. It was quite different. It had a really effective board
of laypeople with a few sisters for a long, long time. It had been coed not so
much by choice as by circumstance but for thirty years so they knew what
they were doing. They were on the west side of San Antonio in the barrio.
They were perceived as really caring about first-generation kids. San Antonio
only graduates from high school 45 percent of the kids who start the ninth
grade.
[00:51:36] San Antonio is not an immigrant city. Immigrants go north.
They go up Highway 35. They go to Chicago. They go various places. So you
have multiple generations of Mexican Americans without education. It is a
military town so many people have gone into the military and the military
pays to educate people. I went expecting an Anglo-Hispanic divide. That is
not the divide in San Antonio. The divide is class. It is between no education
(Anglo or Hispanic) and education.
Our Lady of the Lake had, twenty years before I got there, opened
something that was really unusual and innovative in San Antonio. They had
created a weekend college where people who were employed full-time didn’t
come to school at night [but rather] came on weekends for really intense
programs. Many of them were people who had done a year or two of college
somewhere but couldn’t continue to afford it or for whatever reason had
found themselves not finishing. They worked for places like USAA, the
insurance company, that were prepared to support their tuition as a staff
benefit.

122

One of those was Enron. We had seven hundred students on three
campuses—one in Dallas, one in Houston, and the main campus in San
Antonio—from Enron. When they imploded, we kept anybody who had one
year left. We said to the others, “You have got to pay tuition.” But they did
not have any money to pay tuition because they did not have jobs. It hit
Texas like an A-bomb going off. I had met Ken Lay [Kenneth Lee Lay] many
times.
The issues at Our Lady of the Lake were strategic planning, consistency
of enrollment, how to think about the fact that we were close to the border,
and that we were educating people who were working with people who were
cross-border people.
Tracy: San Antonio is right down on the border?
Mahoney: [00:54:22] No, it is 3 1/2 hours from Laredo and Nuevo Laredo. Everyone
there, although now it’s a mess, talks about one city in two countries. If
you’ve been listening to KQED, Steve Inskeep, one of the people on
[National Public Radio’s Morning Edition], has been visiting the border and
he talked about [Ciudad] Juárez and El Paso.
Tracy: El Paso. That’s what I’m thinking of.
Mahoney: [00:55:00] It was clear from the tone of [Inskeep’s] voice that he was
shocked. It shocked me when I went. You stand at the top floor, which has
windows around all sides, at the Holiday Inn in El Paso at night and you look
into a vast expanse of lights every bit as big as Los Angeles. We’re talking
about millions of people across the border and we’re talking about El Paso

123

[with] several hundred thousand people. People come back and forth all the
time.
I would go to Laredo. We had just under a thousand alums in Mexico.
We had programs that were keyed to the border. We had a PsyD degree in
which we trained people to be counseling psychologists. If they were going
to work, particularly along the border in the colonias between Brownsville and
Laredo or west to El Paso, they were going to be dealing with people who
got medical care in Mexico. Because they were uninsured in Texas, they went
across the border and paid cash for whatever treatment they needed,
including psychological services. We needed to work with professionals on
the other side of the border.
I should say also that professionals on the Mexican side of the river are
highly trained, many of them in the United States, many of them in Canada.
This image that people have of when you cross the border there’s great
decline...there are places in great decline in Mexico but professional services
by doctors and psychologists is not among them. They’re very good.
We needed to know how they worked and so we did two things. We
had a bilingual, bicultural certification in our PsyD degree and in several of
our master’s degrees so that people could work with people who were
bilingual or monolingual Spanish but, more importantly, sought services on
the other side. That meant we made inter-institutional agreements with
universities on the other side: Monterrey Tech [Monterrey Institute of
Technology and Higher Education; Tecnológico de Monterrey] in León and
in Monterrey; and Mayab University [Anahuac Mayab University;

124

Universidad Anáhuac Mayab] which is a private Catholic university in Mérida
near Cancun.
Part of what we needed to do as our strategy was to say what was our
relationship going to be to the border. Up to then we had satellite campuses
in Dallas and Houston (Houston is border but a different kind of border.).
So those kinds of things went along.
I became very involved in civic affairs. The president [Sister Elizabeth
Anne Sueltenfuss], my predecessor, had been an elected member of the San
Antonio Library Commission. She was also a “Sueltenfuss” which was a very
well-known German name in south Texas so people talked about President
Sueltenfuss all the time.
I was drawn in to a number of boards...the United Way of Bexar
County...all sorts of things.
I was involved in trade missions to Mexico. I saw NAFTA [North
American Free Trade Agreement] in a very different light when I went to San
Antonio. When the business community put together a trade mission to
Mexico, their trade mission always included some cultural people by which
they meant museum, higher education, and symphony people—that was
“culture.” I did not speak Spanish. I understood some. All the Mexicans
spoke English but there is some politeness in doing some Spanish so I
learned a little Spanish. I did an intensive three-weeks in Cuernavaca one
summer.
I made common cause with the public institutions. I wrote interinstitutional agreements not only with the San Antonio community colleges

125

but with El Paso and Houston because the issue is how to get firstgeneration students to degrees. Because the Texas legislature does not
support financial aid for Texans very well, students graduating from Texas
[public] universities wind up with bigger loans than students graduating from
Our Lady of the Lake. So we made that case as part of our campaigns.
After we did our strategic plan, it was clear to me that [they needed]
someone who was going to be around for at least another ten years which I
was not prepared to be and needed to move on. [While] I had not been hired
to be an interim president, we were all interim and it is a good thing to know
when to go away. My successor [Tessa Martinez Pollack] was Mexican
American and spent 11 1/2 years. There’s now an interim [Sister Jane Ann
Slater] and they’re going to be looking for another president.
I go back to San Antonio from time to time. My predecessor [Sister
Sueltenfuss] was seventy-five when she retired. For her eighty-fifth, various
people decided to put together a fundraising scholarship dinner that would
honor her. I flew there for that dinner. She was fine. She steeled herself to
get enough energy to be able to sit up on the dais and to be able to speak.
She was getting more and more fragile but it was a wonderful evening. I had
a table with a variety of people who knew me. I came away from that feeling
that the work I had done there had been helpful to where they were going
next. She died within a year of that event. They had raised a half a million
dollars. In San Antonio, Texas, given what salaries are and what the cost of
living is, half a million dollars in one night is a lot of money.

126

[01:03:20] I then came home, for family reasons. I actually stayed in San
Antonio two years after I left Our Lady of the Lake and finished up with
some boards and did some pro bono work with a number of places. Then
my sister was ill so I came home; got involved with the Catholic community
at Stanford; got involved with the school where I am a member of the board
in San Francisco; have since gotten involved with Stevenson House in Palo
Alto; and [have] reconnected to my Rotary and to Belle Haven/Ravenswood
[City School] District. I keep busy—and now with the [Stanford] Historical
Society—so that’s my story.
Tracy: I’m trying to think of anything big to go back to or any last questions that I
had. In reading some articles in preparation for today, I was reminded that
you came to Stanford on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship in English. [laughs]
Did you ever have any sense then that you would...?
Mahoney: [01:04:44] Oh, no. You have to remember that not only did I come to
Stanford originally to study English [but also] that my first Stanford job was
as director of Branner Hall [although] I had no undergraduate experience of
having ever lived in a dorm. [I had no] idea that I would be “waylaid into
administration” which is how Albert Guerard [Stanford English professor]
used to put it. He was happy to [see me] do it because the English
department felt it needed a friend in “the administration,” as lowly as I was in
the administration. [Tracy laughs.] Gradually the work became interesting
and the possibility of contribution became more interesting than going back
to the English department.

127

People in the three places where I served as interim [president] noticed
I had had a Woodrow Wilson and everyone knew that was a great prestige.
Our Lady of the Lake kept asking me when I was going to finish my degree.
I would say, “That’s long gone.”
In between, I had done this degree in the business school, which made
trustees very happy. One of the trustees at Our Lady of the Lake was a
person who was working for AT&T (which was called SBC at the time) and
it had relocated from St. Louis to San Antonio. He looked at my résumé and
he said, “What did being in the Sloan Program teach you?”
I thought: that’s an interesting thing to find out of my résumé. It’s a
little bit like Agnes Scott having found my Rotary presidency. I said, “I can
speak academy to business and business to the academy.”
He said, “Oh, that’s a good answer.”
After the meeting broke up, I discovered he had been a Stanford Sloan
[Fellow] three years earlier. So he would have noticed it.
Tracy: [As] a woman in the administration, were there many other women around?
We sort of know the story of Lucille Allen.
Mahoney: [01:07:27] No, there weren’t. I never noticed it except when people pointed
things out to me. What I noticed in the early days—the SES [Study of
Education at Stanford] days—when I would be brought into meetings
because I had “something to say” [was] that mostly everybody else in the
room were men. What I really noticed was that they were twice my age.
There was an age difference that I was far more aware of than I was of the
gender difference. So that was one piece of it.

128

The night—and I may have spoken of this earlier—that the faculty had
a farewell dinner at the Faculty Club for Ken Pitzer, there were not a dozen
women in the room. There must have been three hundred people in the
room, in the big gold dining room. They were Eleanor Maccoby (who had
been on the Advisory Board), Alberta Siegel, Liz Cohen [Elizabeth G.
Cohen], Leah Kaplan, Mary Sunseri—not the two assistant professors in
English who were Diane Middlebrook and Anne Mellor [Anne
Kostelanetz Mellor]—I did notice that. I was sitting with Joel [Joel Pritchard
Smith] and various [other] people.
What I did notice was that people did not bring their wives. The
invitation I had received said, “This invitation is for the addressee only. We
do not have room for other guests.” Some number of years later, Alberta
Siegel told me that had spouses come Pitzer would have felt the need to
bring his wife, who was very, I think, shocked by what was happening and
who would have burst into tears from time to time. No one wanted that to
happen—I am sure most of all Ken [Pitzer] himself—so it was, “The
invitation is for the addressee only.”
[01:10:15] That was a point at which I was aware of gender.
When Dick Lyman [Richard W. Lyman] offered me the job in his
office as assistant provost and director of summer session, he told me that he
had touched base with the deans I would be working with in the four schools
that had summer session and that no one had any objection. I thought that
was nice. What someone later told me was that he was a little leery because
the person he had touched base with in the School of Engineering was very

129

leery of women administrators, for religious as well as other reasons. But at
no point did I have any hint of that.
The other place I had gotten sort of...I though it charming because he
was quite elderly. James T. Watkins IV, who was, in the 1950s and 1960s,
everybody’s favorite professor in poli-sci, sent me one of these courtesy
notes. [He said] that he had seen the notice that I would become the director
of summer session. He welcomed that. He wanted me to know that he was
teaching summer session that summer. He said what he was teaching. He
said he looked forward to being one of the faculty who worked for
Stanford’s first female dean, signed “James T. Watkins IV.” I just thought it
was an elderly man’s courtesy note, which it was. Its significance did not
wash over me for a long time because other people were thinking that who
were not saying it.
Howard Brooks, who was vice provost, said to me one day just as he
was leaving Stanford—I had known his daughter when she was a resident in
Roble Hall and I was the director; I knew his wife was on the faculty at San
Jose State—that I had solved (as you know) the women’s P.E. problem, or at
least I had advanced its remedy. He thanked me. He said that, some years
before when he was quite junior and part of Fred Terman’s [Frederick
Emmons Terman] staff, there was someone who had just gotten a PhD, a
woman, whom he proposed to Terman come into the Provost’s Office to
help him with a project. Shortly thereafter, someone in Building 10 had called
him in and said that was not to be. The president’s administrative assistant
was already in the President’s Office and that was enough. He said, “So we

130

didn’t hire her, and I was much too junior” (he was new in the office) “to do
anything about it.” He wanted me to know that things had changed and he
was pleased.
I just said, “Thank you, and good luck as you go down to the
Claremont Colleges.” What could I say?
There were always those kinds of things but never once in my day-today working relationships in the Provost’s Office. Business and finance was a
little different, but only parts of it. Certainly by the late 1960s nobody in
student affairs thought this odd. But there simply weren’t very many.
When I started, I was more aware of age than I was gender. I became
more aware of gender as we began to look at faculty. We began to look at
why women were stuck in lectureship roles or research associate roles when
they could be faculty. Why did the wife of that man in the medical school
come up in a search but could not be appointed because there was a
nepotism law that did not really exist. I became aware of those kinds of
things gradually. I never felt they affected me in any adverse way.
Tracy: Another sort of broader question is about how the students changed. I know
Stanford made explicit efforts to diversify the student body. Outside of what
Stanford was doing, [more generally how did] the student body change over
the years?
Mahoney: [01:16:30] As we extended our recruitment reach, it is the case—whether it is
Harvard or us—that a large segment of your student body will come from
within 450 miles of your campus. Now, that is multiple states if you are

131

Harvard and it is California and Hawaii and a little bit of Nevada if you are
Stanford. So when you count states, it comes up different.
As we recruited more broadly, we picked up not only students of color
(whom we were actively recruiting) but also we picked up white students...
we picked up, as we talked about need-blind admissions, people who thought
you had to be rich to go to Stanford. As the pool got larger, we could select
and still have a diverse student body with stronger and stronger students—
students who had breadth as well as depth. Certainly that was obvious as you
moved along.
Since I began advising freshman in 1964 or 1965 and did it until 1992, I
can tell you that my advisees got better and better and better. They also got
entrepreneurial—the individually designed major—the “I want to go co-term
but in a field different from my undergraduate field”—the “I want to go
overseas, but I don’t want to go to a Stanford program; how can I do
that?”—those kinds of things.
By the time I got to Stanford, there was a core of [special] students. It
is why I want to add, if you do not have it already, the name of Dwight Clark,
to the names of people who know something about Stanford students. He is
still around. I saw him not long ago. He started out as an assistant dean of
men, director of Wilbur Hall at Stanford. What he is important for is
Volunteers in Asia [VIA], which had an enormous impact on the student
body at Stanford. When I look at VIA and look at people now in their fifties,
VIA had an enormous impact.

132

When I say entrepreneurial and prepared to work and to expect to be
able to work with the university, with faculty, Tom Fox [now the publisher of
the National Catholic Reporter] and the students who worked with faculty to
bring about the policy on a pan-denominational approach to nondenominational Stanford [were] enormously impactful. People like Tom and
this other student, Steve Martindale, who did that [expected] to be able to sit
down with a couple of key faculty members, lay out their vision, and, if they
could join together, something would happen. There were more and more
people willing to speak up for what would be important elements of
education without having it spoon-fed to them.
Some old things continue. People were very kind to one another.
People thought it was important to have fun. The sort of façade of
Stanford—you run, you play tennis, you do all these things, you are very
good at whatever, and you kind of study when you can—was the image in
the East. What I knew (and I certainly observed firsthand when I became a
resident fellow 1980 to 1983) [was that] that was bogus. Students did all
those things (running and playing tennis and the violin and whatever) but
they got up at four in the morning and were in various parts of the dorm
studying in little groups together and working on problem sets. People did
not study after 9:00 at night because that was when the dorm had its social
life. Nobody had a social life at 7:00 at night; it was 9:00-10:00. People
worked very, very hard but it was taken for granted and, hence, not talked
about.

133

So I think over time adults got enamored of Stanford because they
could come and play tennis in February. Better and better students came and
by the 1980s we were seeing the children of really important people from the
East Coast at Stanford. Some of them were Stanford alums. Justice Breyer’s
[Stephen Breyer] son was at Stanford and he had been a Stanford
undergraduate. News anchors had children at Stanford. All sorts of people
came west, some from prep schools and many from public schools. [Because
of] that effort through the 1970s and into the 1980s in which we expanded
our recruitment, things just got better and better. The quality of the students
got better.
But there continued to be a sense that Stanford had a fundamental
standard and a culture in which people were to care about one another. It
was not considered seemly to try and do in your classmates in a class. Those
kinds of things that people talked about happening elsewhere may have
happened but it was not part of the culture of the place. Those are the
changes that I noticed.
Tracy: Being from Nevada, certainly I knew about Stanford. Stanford was in my
world view but I remember when Chelsea Clinton came to Stanford that, for
me, was...
Mahoney: [01:25:01] We, by then, had a center in Washington, and there were lots and
lots of Stanford people all over Washington: in the Supreme Court, in the
Senate, in the Congress, Dianne Feinstein, all of them, Frank Church from
Idaho. People used to laugh and said that Chelsea went to college as far west
as she could in the Lower 48. My guess is that is probably true. But Sidwell

134

Friends [School] sent all sorts of students here so it was not as if she was the
lone wolf from that school. But, yes, people began to hear prominent names.
I began to notice the Washington names when we began to get people
who either needed Secret Service protection or some other kind of
protection, or students who needed to take their names out of the public
directories because people were worried that their presence would be noted.
That happened after the Patty Hearst kidnapping because of the way that
those abductors found Patty Hearst. They simply went to Sproul Hall and
looked at an open directory and got her address and phone number—which
is something you could have done at Stanford any day of the week. The
Buckley Amendment allowed you to hold your records private but not many
people thought to do that.
But when people started coming from places of prominence, some
adopted different names, for example, Rockefeller. Her father knew the thendirector of the Food Research Institute. She adopted a different kind of last
name. She lived off campus and, if anybody had known who she was, she
was ripe for kidnapping. When her father would come to visit, this man from
Food Research would call me. I would put out the word through a group I
knew she had contact with. They would meet. [It was] very strange. The
Dean of Students Office knew nothing about it. He trusted the registrar to
hold this. But her records, her changed-name records, were out in public.
The fact that there was a name change was in Bob Houghton’s secret file. We
saw more of that.

135

[00:00:00] Of course, with someone like Chelsea Clinton we saw the Secret
Service. We had a question about that raised when Breyer went to the
Supreme Court. I remember when that young man got a call from his
mother. He was in one of the houses were Mark Mancall had been the
resident fellow. His mother said, “Go to the airport and get on the red-eye,
and please bring appropriate clothes —a white shirt and tie and a good blazer
and shined shoes—because we are all going to the White House tomorrow.”
Instantly Mancall knew what that meant, but he [the student] had outgrown
his blazer. It was like that. [Tracy laughs.]
What was interesting—and this is my idea of a Stanford freshman
dorm—word went out that he needed to get to Washington appropriately
clothed. He also needed a haircut and the barbershop was closed. This is 6:00
at night in a FloMo [Florence Moore] dorm. He had to be on a plane at
10:00. There appeared in his room an appropriately sized jacket, a shirt that
fit. He had a tie. His shoes fit. He had all these things. Some student from
the end of the hall had scissors and cut his hair. He went off to the airport.
People coming together to say, “We’ve got to help you,” was a very Stanford
thing to do, but I’m not sure it would happen in a Berkeley dorm or even in a
USC dorm.
No one said, “He’s going to Washington because his father’s going to
have a federal appointment.” Mancall thought he knew what it was but we all
had to wait to see it on TV the next day. People watching TV were not
impressed with his father. People said [of the student], “He looks good.” So

136

that culture which I attribute to the old Stanford was maintained even with a
much more high-powered student body.
